    <p id="p_Description">
     The Cryptographic Algorithm which is most widely used throughout the world
     <br/>
     for  protecting  information.  Cryptography  is  the  art  of  secret  writing,
     <br/>
     followed by the guarantee to authenticate data and messages and protect
     <br/>
     the  systems  from valid attacks  .It  comprises of encryption and decryption
     <br/>
     operations each associated with a key which is supposed to be kept secret .
     <br/>
     We have  implement RC6 Algorithm. Which  is considered as a  secured and
     <br/>
     elegant  choice  for  AES  due  to  its  simplicity,  security,  performance  and
     <br/>
     efficiency.    RC6  supports  32  bit  and  64  bit  processing.  An  eight  step
     <br/>
     operation  is  used  to  encipher  the  64  bit  plain  text  block.  The  encrypted
     <br/>
     data  is then decrypted by performing the reverse operations on the same.
     <br/>
     The  hardware  implementation  of  RC6  algorithm  is  done  using  VHDL
     <br/>
     Hardware Description Language. For  this  implementation Xilinx  foundation
     <br/>
     series 9.2i software and Spartan-3s400pq208-5 kit are being used.
