    <p id="p_Description">
     The project is based on OpenCores' AVR project by Ruslan Lepetenok.
     <br/>
     The core is now hyper pipelined. It is a technique to multiply the functionality
     <br/>
     of a design by adding registers (called pipeline stage registers) to the core logic
     <br/>
     in order to multiply its functionality. If you are interested in the technology, go to www.cloudx.cc
     <br/>
     The functional behavior of the AVR remains the same, the hyper pipelined version
     <br/>
     is used when multiple, equal AVR cores (2, 3, ...) are instantiated in the
     <br/>
     design (multicores).
     <br/>
     The main benefit is the multiplication of the core's functionality by only
     <br/>
     implementing registers. This leads to a reduced size compared to the
     <br/>
     individual instantiation of the cores. This is a great advantage for ASICs
     <br/>
     but obviously very attractive for FPGAs with their already existing registers.
     <br/>
     Another issue is the performance of the resulting hyper pipelined AVR core.
     <br/>
     The pipeline stage registers are timing driven placed to partition the critical
     <br/>
     path into equal parts, which leads to an almost multiplied performance of the
     <br/>
     design. The timing is optimized for a Spartan 3 and a Virtex 5 device from Xilinx.
     <br/>
     The modifications are done on RTL, so that the project can be used in an
     <br/>
     RTL based testbench.
     <br/>
     The project shows the modified RTL code with 2, 3 and 4 times multiplied
     <br/>
     functionality. It is delivered with a testbench and a detailed documentation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Enjoy ...
