    <p id="p_Description">
     This VHDL macro is a Text Mode Monochrome Video Display Adapter for VGA monitors. It can be used as a peripheral for a soft-processor, external microcontroller or other non-programmable hardware. It's not much better than the original IBM MDA card appeared in 1981 ;-)

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - resolution is 80x40 characters, dot resolution is 640x480 pixels at 60Hz so the core needs a clock signal of 25MHz. I prefer 80x40 instead the classical 80x25, in my opinion, the latter is an annoyance.
     <br/>
     - monocrome, it hasn't "attribute" memory to store the color of each character. The unique output color is selectable among 8 different colours
     <br/>
     - the video text buffer is an external memory (or BRAM inside the FPGA) of 80&#215;40 = 3200 bytes. The character at (column, row) = (0, 0) is at the RAM address 0, the character at (79, 39) is at 3199.
     <br/>
     - 8-bit ASCII codes (iso-latin-0 or other that you prefer)
     <br/>
     - the ROM that store fixed-width bitmap font is also external, the bitmap can be changed modifying the COE file. The COE file provided is iso-8859-15 (also called iso-latin-0), is very similar to the iso-8859-1 but with the Euro (&#8364;) symbol added.
     <br/>
     - hardware cursor, with two different shapes; with enable/disable control.
     <br/>
     - simple IO interface. Three registers
     <br/>
     -  CRX. Position (column) for HW cursor
     <br/>
     - CRY. Position (row) for HW cursor
     <br/>
     - CTL. Control register for de/activate the HW cursor, change its shape, de/activate VGA signal, output colour, etc.
     <br/>
     - uses 100 slices in a Xilinx Spartan-3.
     <br/>
     - the design is vendor-agnostic. You can use it in Xilinx/PicoBlaze, Altera/NIOSII or with other non-programmable hardware.
