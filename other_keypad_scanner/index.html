     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     This is a very small and simple module, which scans through an X-Y matrix of keys, and produces a "snapshot" of bits which represent the sampled state of the keyswitches during the scan.
     <br/>
     There is memory in the module, so that the outputs are held constant during a scan, and updated simultaneously.  The keys are sampled sequentially, but the memory stores up all of the keyswitch data until the final output "snapshot" is produced.
     <br/>
     This module is parameterized Verilog, and is recommended for use with small matrix type keypads.  It has been tested in real hardware.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - Parameterized Verilog code, tested in hardware
     <br/>
     - Commented code, but no testbench
     <br/>
     - Small module, easy to use and understand
     <br/>
     - No support for "ghost key" detection (when three or more keys are pressed, a fourth "phantom key" can sometimes appear.  This is true for most matrix type keyboards.)
