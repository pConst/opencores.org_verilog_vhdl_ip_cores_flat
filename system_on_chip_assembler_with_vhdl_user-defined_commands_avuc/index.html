     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     Here is proposed a method to implement short structured programs inside an FPGA. The novelty of the proposed method resides in that the commands that constitute the executable program are defined directly by the user in VDHL code. Applying this method, the resolution of a problem can be partitioned in two: on the one hand, the  complex hardware functions can be implemented by the VHDL definitions, while, on the other hand, the higher level take of decisions, loops, iterations and conditional branching or testing can be assumed by the executable program.
     <br/>
     The user has to follow two steps: first, to define, using VHDL, the commands that form the language, and second, to write the program using the commands that have been defined before.

     Implementation of predefined commands call and return, making possible the use of subroutines. This should come with the creation of a simple stack.
