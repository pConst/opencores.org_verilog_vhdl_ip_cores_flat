    <p id="p_Description">
     A HyperTransport Tunnel controller written in SystemC. HyperTransport (HT) is a high-performance chip-to-chip interconnect architecture.  A tunnel has two HT ports to allow it to be used inside a chain of components.

More information about HyperTransport can be found at the
     
      HyperTransport Consortium web site
     
     .

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - Written in synthesisable SystemC
     <br/>
     - Designed with the HyperTransport 2.0b specification
     <br/>
     - Core configurable options include:
     <br/>
     - Retry mode
     <br/>
     - DirectRoute
     <br/>
     - In-vc packet reordering
     <br/>
     - Extendable configuration register space
     <br/>
     - Buffer size
     <br/>
     - Either internal or external deserializer data alignment
     <br/>
     - 2, 4 or 8-bit link support
     <br/>
     - Platform independent
     <br/>
     - Throughput of 32 x Core Frequency bits/s (An FPGA running at 100 Mhz could have an 8-bit link at 400 MT/s, an FPGA running at 75 Mhz could have a 4-bit link at 600 MT/s or an ASIC running at 250Mhz could have an 8-bit link running at 1000 MT/s)

     Status
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Status">
     - High level documentation currently being worked on
     <br/>
     - Complete, but not prototyped
     <br/>
     - There are many testbenches, most of them are self-checking but others only produce output that must be manually inspected.  The testbenches were designed to quickly validate the design, not for full coverage of limit cases.
