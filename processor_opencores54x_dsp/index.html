    <p id="p_Description">
     The OpenCores54x (OC54x) DSP core is a cleanroom implementation of a popular family of DSPs designed by the No.1 DSP supplier from the southern part of the US.
     <br/>
     The core is designed to be software compliant with the original Texas Instruments C54x DSP. However, the core is not designed to be 100% compatible with the TI's C54x chips. The core features some extension and improvements over the original design, which make it not-compatible. Also, partially caused by the structure choosen, partially to not completely compete with TI, some operating modes and hence opcodes are not supported. See the compatibility section for more detailes.

     Compatibility
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Compatibility">
     Listed below are known issues between this implementation and Texas Instruments C54x DSPs.
     <br/>
     - CMPT is not supported.
     <br/>
     The compatibility bit is not supported. As a result ARP is always set to zero.
     <br/>
     - EDB is 32bits wide,
     <br/>
     The EB data bus is 32bits wide to support single cycle 32bit write accesses. Long words are always written in 1 cycle. In contrast to the C54x there's no difference between even and odd word addresses. The MSB is always written at the higher address.
