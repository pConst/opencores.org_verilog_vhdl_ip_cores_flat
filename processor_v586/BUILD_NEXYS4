BUILD FPGA BIT FIEL
list of files to add for ISE project:
./rtl/*
./ucf/*
./boot/*.mem

after having produced the .bit file

BUILDING KERNEL
download kernel and untar it
copy ./config/.config into the dir
and type 'make'
after a while go into ./arch/x86/boot/compressed
and do 
objdump -O binary vmlinux.bin vmlinux.raw
cp vmlinux.raw vmlinux.bin 

BUILDING INITRAMFS
put all your data inside a dir
cd dir
find . | cpio -H newc -o > ../initramfs.cpio
cd ../
cat initramfs.cpio | gzip > root.bin

BUILDING PROM FILE FOR SPI
with ise-impact select generate prom
1-select single fpga config
2-select spi 128Mbit
3-set YES for add user data
then add
fpga bit file
then add user data
at address 0x400000 the vmlinux.bin
at address 0x800000 the root.bin 

SIMPLER
or simply flash the mcs file inside :
./mcs
inside spi flash with impact



NOTICE:
on nexys4 board don't forget to put SW1 and SW2 ON otherwise the design is under test modes.
