rtl:
contains the RTL of the core and platform elements in stuctural verilog
the processor is in one file : v586.v 
TOP_SYS.v put the processor with a wishbone interface , an sram inteface
and rom for boot.

ucf:
constraint file for ISE and nexys4

mcs:
image files to put inside SPI 128Mbit flash with fpga bit file and vmlinux and initramfs

mcs map:
0x0: fpga bit file
0x400000: vmlinux uncompressed
0x800000: iniramfs compressed

bin:
contains binary files that have been used to build mcs file

config:
.config file used for configure vmlinux.bin kernel in v3.17 kernel version


boot:
contains assembly source of the internal rom boot

tb:
run scripts for simulation : run_verilator_simu.sourceme
contains testbench source and script to run simulation under verilator.
it will take around 25mins to see first messages for linux boot banner.
There are also scripts to build memory files for simulation , used inside 
mem models 

note: mem models for boot are necessary for ise compilation for the internal rom
the script run_sw.scr builds mem files.

uart16750:
just recopy tar file from opencores of the rtl/vhdl sources that are used for the serial interface.
In fact inside fpga or simulation the model used is a mapped netlist from this vhdl and the netlist is inside the rtl directory, it is uart_16750.v.
