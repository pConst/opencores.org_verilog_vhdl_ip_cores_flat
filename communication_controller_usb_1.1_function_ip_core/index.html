     Description

    <p id="p_Description">
     USB 1.1 slave/device IP core. Default configuration is 6 endpoints:
     <br/>
     1 Control, 1 Isochronous IN, 1, Isochronous Out, 1 Bulk IN, 1 Bulk
     <br/>
     Out, 1 Interrupt IN. Includes control engine, providing full enumeration
     <br/>
     process in hardware - no external micro-controller necessary.
     <br/>
     Derived from my USB 2.0 Function IP core, except all the high speed
     <br/>
     support logic has been ripped out and the interface was changed from
     <br/>
     shared memory to FIFO based.
     <br/>
     A basic test bench is now included as well.  It should be viewed
     <br/>
     as a starting point to write a more comprehensive and complete
     <br/>
     test bench.
     <br/>
     I expect the users of this core to have some fundamental USB knowledge
     <br/>
     and be familiar with the UTMI specification and with the general USB
     <br/>
     transceivers (e.g. from philips). If you are not familiar with these two
     <br/>
     you should check out www.usb.org and read up on this subject ...
