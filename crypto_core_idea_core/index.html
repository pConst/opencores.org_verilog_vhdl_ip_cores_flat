     Description

    <p id="p_Description">
     The IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a symmetric-key block cipher that can encrypts 64-bits plaintexts to 64-bit ciphertexts using a 128-bit key, used for secure communications.  It is also can do decryption with the same block using the same key.
     <br/>
     It consists of 8 computationally identical rounds and an output transformation. A 64-bit input block is divided into four 16-bit blocks which become the input blocks to the first round of the algorithm. In each of the eight total rounds, the four sub-blocks are XOR-ed, added, and multiplied with one another and with six 16-bit sub-keys.
     <br/>
     IDEA runs 177 Mbps in speed on hardware implementation.
     <br/>
     The IDEA block cipher was found by J. L. Massey and X. Lay.
