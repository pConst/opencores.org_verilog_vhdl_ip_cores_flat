    <p id="p_Description">
     sub86 is a frugal 32bits cpu that executes a small subset of the legacy x86-32 instructions.
     <br/>
     The core has been designed with a C compiler back end code generator with three focus :
     <br/>
     - limit the number of opcode and instructions as much as possible.
     <br/>
     - the resulting binary code must run functionally equivalent on real PC and on sub86 core.
     <br/>
     - make the core as small as possible, by limiting the number of required hardware ressources ( alu , multiplier , number of registers : only EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX/ESP/EBP/PC/flags registers are implemented).
     <br/>
     The status of the development (in Dec 2012) is debugging using dhrystone on a small subsystem, as of now the system shows
     <br/>
     a 0.22DMIPS/MHz or 22DMIPS @ 100MHz.
     <br/>
     Also test are on going for running a unix like os (xinu) in a 94kB snapshot.
     <br/>
     The limited opcodes implemented creates bigger binaries, around 1.5x has been observed.
     <br/>
     In the SVN repository there is only the verilog file for the core and no test bench, for the moment.
