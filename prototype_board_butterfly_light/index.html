    <p>
     The
     
      Butterfly Light
     
     is an open source, modular FPGA development board. It is comprised of the
     
      USB Cocoon
     
     and the
     
      Spartan 3E Cocoon
     
     which paired together create the Butterfly Light FPGA development board. The Butterfly Light is best suited for developers who prefer to create their own daughterboards instead of utilizing the "
     
      Wing
     
     " peripheral system. The Butterfly Light exposes the maximum amount of I/O of all available Butterflies. It is also well suited for use with the
     
      Logic Analyzer
     
     software which implements a 100Mhz, 32 channel
     
      Logic Analyzer
     
     .

     <li>
      Using the design as the basis for a commercial or non commercial product. In this scenario all that is required is that "Butterfly Platform" and "

     </li>
     <li>
      Using the design as is or modifying it for a personal or educational project.
     </li>
     <li>
      Manufacturing boards for personal usage.
     </li>
     <li>
      Manufacturing boards for unique commercial products. We highly encourage using the design to derive unique products. What we discourage is manufacturing and selling boards for a product that is not unique from what someone else created. Let the original creator manufacture and sell the boards, unless of course they have no interest in doing so.
