      The Amber processor core is an ARM-compatible 32-bit RISC processor. The Amber core
      <br/>
      is fully compatible with the ARM&#174; v2a instruction set architecture (ISA) and is
      <br/>
      therefore supported by the GNU toolset. The Amber project provides a complete embedded
      <br/>
      system incorporating the Amber core and a number of peripherals, including a UART, a
      <br/>
      timer and an Ethernet MAC.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      There are two versions of the core provided in the Amber project. The Amber 23 has
      <br/>
      a 3-stage pipeline, a unified instruction &amp; data cache, a 32-bit Wishbone
      <br/>
      interface, and is capable of 0.75 DMIPS per MHz. The Amber 25 has a 5-stage
      <br/>
      pipeline, seperate data and instruction caches, a 128-bit Wishbone interface,
      <br/>
      and is capable of 1.05 DMIPS per Mhz. Both cores implement exactly the same ISA
      <br/>
      and are 100% software compatible. The cores do not contain a memory management
      <br/>
      unit (MMU) so they can only run the non-virtual memory variant of Linux. The
      <br/>
      cores has been verified by booting a 2.4 Linux kernel.
      <br/>
      The cores were developed in Verilog 2001, and are optimized for FPGA synthesis.
      <br/>
      For example there is no reset logic, all registers are reset as part of FPGA
      <br/>
      initialization. The complete system has been tested extensively on the Xilinx SP605
      <br/>
      Spartan-6 FPGA board. The full Amber system with the A23 core uses 32% of the
      <br/>
      Spartan-6 XC6SLX45T-3 FPGA Look Up Tables (LUTs), with the core itself
      <br/>
      occupying less than 20% of the device using the default configuration, and running at
      <br/>
      40MHz. It has also been synthesized to a Virtex-6 device at 80MHz.
      <br/>
      The older v2a version of the ARM instruction set is supported because it is still
      <br/>
      fully supported by the GNU tool chain and is not covered by patents so can be
      <br/>
      implemented without a license from ARM. For a description of the ISA, see
