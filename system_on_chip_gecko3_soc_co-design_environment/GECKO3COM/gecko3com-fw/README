# README -- the short version

The top level makefile handles the FX2 firmware.

You'll need the SDCC free C compiler to build the firmware.  You MUST
USE VERSION 2.4.0 or VERSION 2.5.0 due to some problems with variable
initialization.  http://sdcc.sourceforge.net

If you've got doxygen installed, there are html docs in
doc/html/index.html

Possible make targets:
* make (default will build the firmware as hex file)
* make iic (will generate a downloadable iic file using Hex2Bix.exe with wine)
* make doc (will generate the html documentation using doxygen)
