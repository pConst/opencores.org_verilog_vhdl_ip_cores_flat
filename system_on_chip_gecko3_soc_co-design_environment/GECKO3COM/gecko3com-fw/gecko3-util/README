Simple small helper tool for GECKO3COM

  With this tool you can set the serial number, hw revision
  and FPGA type of a GECKO3COM driven device. 
  mainly this is the GECKO3main but the firmware could be
  used on other boards.

  Warning: This tool does only work on little endian machines! 

Usage: gecko3-util [options] ...
  -h --help			Print this help message
  -V --version			Print the version number
  -v --verbose
  -d --device vendor:product	Specify Vendor/Product ID of GECKO3COM device
  -t --transfer-size		Specify the number of bytes per USB Transfer
  -s --set-serial		Write the Serial Number. Expects a String as argument
  -r --set-hw-rev		Write the Hardware Revision. Only one digit
  -f --set-fpga-type		Write the FPGA type. Formated as ASCII String
  -i --set-fpga-idcode		Write the FPGA JTAG IDCODE. This is a 32bit Integer value

Example:
  GECKO3main, first version, with a Spartan3 with 4 Mio. gates and the serial number 36:
  gecko3-util --set-hw-rev 0 --set-fpga-type 3s4000fg676 --set-fpga-idcode 0x01448093 --set-serial 36

Installation:
  To build the tool type "make" in the gecko3-util folder. The libusb header 
  files have to be installed for this.

  There is also a installation rule in the Makefile which copies the 
  gecko3-util to "/usr/local/bin". For this type as usual "make install" in the
  gecko3-util folder.

Changelog:
Version 1.1 22. September 2009: 
Corrected two bugs. 
- The gecko3-util wrongly counted some hubs as GECKO3COM devices. 
- After the --device option no argument was allowed (segmentation fault)
