	* firmware/lib/ser.c
	added library functions for rs232 communication. based on a source
	code provided by sdcc, modified to use the fast baudrate generator
	of the FX2

	* firmware/include/debugprint.h
	macro definitions to send debug messages to stdout using the
	printf_small function. (you have to provide your own putchar and
	getchar function as explained in the sdcc documenttion).
	it provides different levels of output messages, you can select
	the desired level in the make file. all unused function calls are
	removed by the preprocessor
	

2006-Nov-19  Christoph Zimmermann  <zac1@bfh.ch>

	* firmware/src/Makefile.unix
	fixed the last error in the make file. the order of the object
	files is now correct for the linker (the irq vector tables have to
	come first). original usrp fw is now working on the dev board
