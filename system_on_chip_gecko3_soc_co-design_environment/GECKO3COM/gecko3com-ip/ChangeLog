I achieved now stable OUT transfers (from the PC to the FPGA) with working throtling (when the FPGA consumes data slower than the host delivers).
The basics needed for this are implemented in the FPGA like handshaking with the FX2 and clock domain transistion from the Interface clock to the user defined system clock.

in the gpif_com_test.vhd is a message rom, containing a prepared answer message to generate an IN transfer. this is needed for the next step.

reorganising and renaming the stuff in these project.

the core will get the name "GECKO3COM_" followed by the type "simple", "plb" or "opb"
to follow the naming in the GECKO3 wiki and to show the IP core interface.

duplicated fifo corecenerator files are merged together including a wrapper to easily supress synthesizer warnings
from unavailable, unused and unconnected pins.

the project is now organised in a way how the IP core and it's parts are beeing used. this means that the
low-level gpif access module is instantiated by the higher level modules and not the other way around.
this will make more sense when more parts of this IP core are finished (planning is finished, they have
to be implemented and tested now).

this is the version 0.4 of the GECKO3com IP core.

This is the last version from Andreas Habegger, the maintainer for this core is now Christoph Zimmermann

initial add of the version 0.3 of the GECKO3com IP core. originaly developped by Andreas Habegger.

this commit is just for backup and to make the project progress visible because version 0.4 is also ready and will be commited in the next step.
