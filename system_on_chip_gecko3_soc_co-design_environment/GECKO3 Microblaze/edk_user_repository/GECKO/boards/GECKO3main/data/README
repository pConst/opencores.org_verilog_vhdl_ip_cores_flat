The folder "edk_user_repository" contains the board support package for the GECKO3main module to use in Xilinx EDK

Extract this file in the folder where the EDK folder is located. Don't extract it inside the EDK folder! 
After extracting you should have a "edk_user_repository" folder on the same level as the EDK installation folder.

Compatible with EDK 8.2 and 9.1. 

Known issues:
- EDK 9.2 and above is not supported yet (Xilinx changed the IP-Core they use for memory interfaces. This gives us a lot of problems)

- The 128 Mbyte DDR RAM configurations does not work yet. I'm unsure where the problem is.
