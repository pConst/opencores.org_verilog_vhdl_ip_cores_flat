     <b>
      HPDMC is part of the
      
       Milkymist System-on-Chip
      
      , the most advanced open source SoC for interactive multimedia applications.
     </b>
     <br/>
     Fast DDR SDRAM controller with features targeted at high-bandwidth burst-oriented applications such as live video processing. The core has been re-used by several projects and institutions, such as the NASA as part of a software-defined radio system for the ISS (CoNNeCT experiment).

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - Current design is targeted at 32-bit wide DDR SDRAM.
     <br/>
     - Dedicated non-standard high-speed bus for efficient memory access (FML).
     <br/>
     - Pipelined accesses to hide DRAM latencies.
     <br/>
     - WISHBONE to FML bridge available with cache support.
     <br/>
     - FML arbiter with pipelining support available for high-speed DMA.
     <br/>
     - Fully synchronous controller (memory clock = controller clock) to avoid clock domain crossing latencies.
     <br/>
     - CSR bus interface for configuration.
     <br/>
     - Low level interface to the SDRAM chip is possible ("bypass" mode).
     <br/>
     - SDRAM initialization sequence performed by the system CPU to save hardware resources and maximize flexibility.
     <br/>
     - Timing parameters configured at runtime.
     <br/>
     - Page hit detection supports multiple open banks.
     <br/>
     - Automatic refresh with programmable refresh interval.
