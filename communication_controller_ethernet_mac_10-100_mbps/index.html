    <p id="p_Description">
     The Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control), sublevel within the Data Link Layer of the OSI reference model. This core is designed for implementation of CSMA/CD LAN in accordance with the IEEE 802.3 standards.
     <br/>
     The MAC is the portion of ethernet core that handles the CSMA/CD protocol for transmission and reception of frames. It peforms Frame Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation, Frame Transmission, and Frame Reception.
     <br/>
     Size is approximately 28k gates (2400 flip-flops).
