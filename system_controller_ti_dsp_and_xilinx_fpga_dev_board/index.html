    <p id="p_Description">
     A project aimed at providing a DSP/FPGA based development board. 

Testing has begun, so far Power supplies, DSP, FPGAs have been proven to be 100% functional. Testing of the SDRAM and FLASH memories has be started and will require time  for pattern read/write to be completed. 

If you are interested in this dev kit please contact me by my email address. I will be happy to call/email you back with more details. We have 3 more kits available, but will require assembling (typ. 2 weeks) before they can be shipped. We have not determined a price for kits yet, but reasonable offers will be accepted. 

We are also working a seconday IDE to the TI CCS to allow lower cost development. This is not a primary task as we have CCS2, but realise that for students/personal use CCS2 is too expensive. We are considering opening a compile farm to allow users to upload a project and receive a compiled a.out file that would be loaded into the Flash via HPI from a PC with download utilities. If you would like to help on this aspect, please contact me by email.

A datashort is provided at http://www.qortek.com/products.aspx additionally you can contact QorTek for Pricing of Kits. Kit prices are determined to cover parts, pcb and assembly, or partial assembly. Sorry we can't give these away :(

     SDRAM was tested at full EMIF speed (100Mhz) Initial testing showed no problems.

EMIF to WB_Master interface implemented. Tested working at 50Mhz, optimitize to work at 100Mhz.

     DSP cards tested in cPCI chassis, and PCI bus testing began!! Working out a few issues between WB master and WB Slave on PCI core.

     DSP and PCI core are talking via WB interface! WB bus speed has been droped to 50MHz due to PCI core timing constraints. A second cPCI communication card developed by QorTek is being programmed with the PCI core and an internal RAM Block for DSP to PCI access testing. 

A few schematic entry errors have been identified and fixed for a REV 1 release. None of the errors are show stoppers! A new release of the schematic will appear soon noting schemitcal errors.

     Lots of HDL coding and simulation and in system testing has been done. We are working to release a core for the board to connect the DSP to the PCI Core.

     We have begun writing FPGA and DSP code to link the PCI Bridge to the DSP and also allow users to program the DSP from the HPI.
