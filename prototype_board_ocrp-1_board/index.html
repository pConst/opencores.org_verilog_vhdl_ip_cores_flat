     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     OpenCores Reference Platform 1 (OCRP-1) standalone board was designed as a common prototype platform for testing our IP cores. It has a central FPGA for evaluating and testing IP cores, I/O capabilities, DRAM and FLASH memory. It also has several I/O, JTAG and expansion connectors. It even has real-time clock and a battery. Current PCBs have four layers.

     It is a 4 layer multilayer with solder mask, hot air leveling finish and
component print on both sides. All boards have been electronicly tested
against the Gerber data (
     
      picture
     
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Shipping is done by normal air mail in an envelope protected by sealed air.
Each letter will contain an official invoice calling the product "printed
carrier board for education and evaluation purpose". 
Wilhelm Mikroelektronik is not responsible for any problems with customs and they do not give any
warranty on the board. They don't take responsibility for any problems that
might occur when assembling the board and they can&#180;t provide any support for
the board.
    </p>
    <p>
     We would like to stress that the fine pitch SMD parts are not intended for
the unexperienced people. You should be sure that you can assemble it.
If there is actually a problem with any of the boards (this should not
happen because of electronic testing) Wilhelm Mikroelektronik will of course provide a free replacement of the PCB.
    </p>
    <p>
     If anybody need the stencils for solder cream. They can provide that, too.
The price per pair (top/bottom) is USD 100 including shipping. Just add to
the order sheet manually.
For manual soldering the stencils are not required.

     Just completly fill in
     
      order form
     
     and it fax back to the Wilhelm Mikroelektronik. They will immediatly process the order. There should be sufficient number of boards on stock. Worldwide registered and insured shipping is now per piece. Payment options are credit card or prepayment to their account (if you can't do credit card payment).
