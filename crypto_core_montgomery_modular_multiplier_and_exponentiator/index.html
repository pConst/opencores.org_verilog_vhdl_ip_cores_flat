     Modular multiplication and modular exponentiation play an important role in the most
     <br/>
     of existing cryptographic systems. In fact these are time and hardware consuming
     <br/>
     operations.
     <br/>
     Up to now there were proposed modular multiplication and modular exponentiation
     <br/>
     implementations. One of them, Montgomery method, is very efficient especially if
     <br/>
     modulus is coprime integer with the word length in which it is operated, what is
     <br/>
     always true in binary systems
     <br/>
     In this project Montgomery multiplier and Montgomery exponentiation blocks was
     <br/>
     developed. They were prepared for Spartan 3ES500 FPGA in Spartan 3E Starter Board
     <br/>
     developed by DIGILENT, but can be easily suited in another cores. In its basic
     <br/>
     they were prepared for 64 bit and 512 bit word length (due to the FPGA capacity),
     <br/>
     and the way of the cores expanding was presented.
