beta0002 February 2, 2015
1. endsim(): renamed argument from force to force_stop for clarity.
2. print2(string, string): corrected call, from print() to print2().
3. print2(pltbv_t, pltbs_t, string): corrected call, from print() to print2().
4. pltbutils_func_pkg.vhd: more comments.
5. waitsig(): added overloaded unclocked variant.
6. hxstr(): no longer wrapper for hstr, improved with unlimited length of 
   argument s.
7. Updated author's email address in all files where applicable.

beta0001 April 9, 2014
1. Added check() for string.

alpha0007 January 13, 2014
1. Renamed example/vhdl/*.* to examples/vhdl/examples2/*.*
   This is example code where the testcase process(es) are located
   in a testcase component, enabling multiple testcase architectures.
   Renamed sim/example_sim/ to sim/modelsim_tb_example2/
2. Created examples/vhdl/examples1/ 
   This is example code where the testcase process is located in the
   testbench top.
   Created sim/modelsim_tb_example1/
3. Renamed sim/bench_sim/ to sim/modelsim_tb_pltbutils/
4. Renamed template/vhdl/*.* to templates/vhdl/template2/*.*
5. Created templates/vhdl/template1/ 
6. Updated specification_pltbutils.docx/pdf to rev 0.5

alpha0006 January 09, 2014
1. Replaced shared variables with a normal variable, and global signals with
   a normal signal.
   VHDL-2000 and later requires that shared variables use protected types,
   but protected types weren't available in earlier VHDL versions.
   As a consequence, some simulators in VHDL-200x mode require protected
   types. But some simulators still don't support protected types at all.
   To make pltbutils work in all (or at least in most) VHDL simulators,
   shared variables have now been removed. 
   In previous versions of pltbutils, protected types were used by default.
   There were comments in the pltbutils code as an aid to modify the code
   for simulators that don't support protected types, but it was too much
   work to do the modifications. One possible solution could have been to
   make separate variants of pltbutils; one with, and one without protected
   types. But that solution was not tempting.
2. Removed src/vhdl/pltbutils_type_pkg.vhd .
3. Added doc/required_updates.txt .

alpha0005 January 05, 2014
1. In pltbutils_func_pkg.vhd, added starttest() and endtest().
2. testname() is now depricated, and will be removed. Use starttest() instead.
3. Added pltbutils_user_cfg_pkg.vhd and modified pltbutils_func_pkg.vhd to
   support user configurable report messages, to support continous
   integration environments, e.g. TeamCity.
4. Updated specification.

alpha0004 December 3, 2013
1. Corrected returned ranges from to_ascending() and to_descending()
   in pltbutils_func_pkg.vhd, to make them work with vectors where the lowest
   bit does not have number 0.

alpha0003 December 2, 2013
1. Added a line feed before printing the test name for clarity,
   in procedure testname() in pltbutils.vhd .
2. Added functions to_ascending(), to_descending() and hxstr()
   in pltbutils.vhd (not yet included in the specification).
3. check() in pltbutils.vhd now outputs hexadecimal values instead of
   binary values for std_logic_vector, unsigned and signed.
4. Updated tb_example.vhd, tc_example.vhd and tc1.vhd to feed
   the generic G_DISABLE_BUGS to tc1. 
   The message "Bug here somewhere" is now only output when
   G_DISABLE_BUGS=0.   

alpha0002 November 10, 2013
1. Added doc/release_note.txt
2. Removed file paths from pltbutils_files.lst
3. Added overloaded print procedures with boolean argument called active, 
   which is useful for debug switches, etc.
4. Added inverted clock output and a generic for setting initial value to 
   pltbutils_clkgen in  pltbutils_comp.vhd and pltbutils_comp_pkg.vhd .
   The inverted clock output can be used when a differential
   clock is needed.
5. Added overloaded procedures waitsig().   
6. Updated specification.
