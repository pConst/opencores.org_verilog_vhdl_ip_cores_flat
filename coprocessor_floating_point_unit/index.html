    <p id="p_Description">
     This is a single precision floating point unit. It is fully IEEE 754 compliant. It can currently perform Add/Sub,  Mul and Divide operations, as well as integer to floating point and floating point to integer conversions. It supports four rounding modes: Round to Nearest Even, Round to Zero, Round to +INF and Round to -INF.
     <br/>
     There is now also a separate FP compare unit. It is located in the fpu/fcmp directory.

     To the best of my knowledge the FPU is 100% IEEE 754 compliant. I have run over 14Mil. test vectors on it,  that where generated using the SoftFloat library by John R. Hauser, which can be found at:
     
      http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html
     
     . 
The test pattern generator is included with the distribution.

     It is very difficult to partition such a complex piece of hardware for optimal pipe lining. Therefore you will need a synthesis tool that has a "retiring" feature to obtain best results.
     <br/>
     Actual Add/Sub, Multiply and Divide cores must be replaced in the primitives.v file, or your synthesis tool must be able to synthesize them for you. I might fix this in the future.

     - Second version of the core is released. Included with the release is also a  test bench and a test pattern generator.
     <br/>
     - I won't be doing any more work on the core in the near future, except for bug fixes.
     <br/>
     - The core can be downloaded from OpenCores CVS via cvsweb or via cvsget (use fpu for module name)
