== MicroWeb v0.01 ==

This program is a Web Server and TCP/IP stack for 8051 microcontrollers. 
It started out as my Senior Project while a Senior at Bradley University. 
I hope to expand it to work on other microcontrollers and be used in a 
variety of applications.

This version is meant to be compiled with SDCC on Linux.
