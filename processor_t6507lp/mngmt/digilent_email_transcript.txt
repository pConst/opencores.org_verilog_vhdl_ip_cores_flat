    Hello Gabriel,

    You are free to use any reference designs that are available on our website on an as-is basis as long as you are not using the code for profit.  Depending on the specifics of what you wish to do, we may have to issue you a license.  I have forwarded this message onto our business director, who should be able to best answer this question.

    Let us know if you have further questions or concerns.


    Regards,

    Dion Moses

    Hi,

    I`d like to buy a S3BOARD. But first I`d like to know if I may use your keyboard/vga controller code included in your demo. Those codes are under which copyright? Can I use them in a real chip, i.e. to send a chip to a fab? They will be part of a non-comercial project under development at NSCAD (www.nscad.org). The project main goal is to elaborate a tutorial for university students.

    This is the file I'd like to use:

    Please contact us if you need further information.
