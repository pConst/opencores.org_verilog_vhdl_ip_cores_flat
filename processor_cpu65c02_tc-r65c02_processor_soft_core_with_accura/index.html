    <p id="p_Description">
     The 65C02 by Rockwell is the upgraded version of the legendary Rockwell's R6502. cpu65c02_tc offers you an accurate timing for all new and upgraded op codes of the R65C02. This soft core was generated in VHDL and was designed with Mentor's HDL Designer.
     <br/>
     It comes also with graphical views formatted in HTML to show and explain very clearly the hierarchy of the whole design.

     Features

    <p id="p_Features">
     - true cycle timing for all official opcodes
     <br/>
     - unknown op's decoded as "NOP/special op codes"
     <br/>
     - one clock source
     <br/>
     - input signal "rdy_i" for generating waitstates (see attached specification of R65C02)
     <br/>
     - output signal "sync_o" to indicate an op fetch (see attached specification of R65C02)
     <br/>
     - input signal "so_n_i" sets the internal OV Flag (see attached specification of R65C02)
     <br/>
     - fully synthesizable VHDL

     <br/>
     Revision 1.5 RC 2013/07/31 11:53:00 (RELEASE CANDIDATE)
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix CMP (IND) - wrongly decoded as function AND
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix BRK should clear decimal flag in P Reg
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix JMP (ABS,X) - Low Address outputted twice - no High Address
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix Unknown Ops - Used always 1b2c NOP ($EA) - new NOPs created
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix DECIMAL ADC and SBC (all op codes - "C" flag was computed wrong)
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix INC/DEC ABS,X - N/Z flag wrongly computed
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix RTI - should increment stack pointer
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix "E" &amp; "B" flags (Bits 5 &amp; 4) - should be always "1" in P Reg. Change "RES", "RTI", "IRQ" &amp; "NMI" substates.
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix ADC and SBC (all sub codes - "Overflow" flag was computed wrong)
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix RMB, SMB Bug - Bit position decoded wrong
     <br/>
     Revision 1.4  2013/07/21 11:11:00 (internal copy only - not published)
     <br/>
     - Changing the title block and internal revision history
     <br/>
     - Bug Fix STA [(IND)] op$92 ($92 was missed in the connection list at state FETCH)
     <br/>
     Feb-25-2009
     <br/>
     - Correct "RTI" (wrong: use of stack pointer)
     <br/>
     - Correct "RMBx" &amp; "SMBx" (wrong: bit translation)
     <br/>
     - Rename all states of "FSM Execution Unit" for better reading
     <br/>
     - (85%) Finish working for Specification of cpu65C02_tc
     <br/>
     - Correct timing for addressing mode "ABS,X" for "INC" (wrong: 6 cycles instead of 7)
     <br/>
     - Optimize end states of "STA" (s197,s207,s200,s213)
     <br/>
     Jan-04-2009
     <br/>
     - Deleted unused/duplicated nets, registers and modules. Renamed some blocks. Synthesis run now without warnings.
     <br/>
     Dec-01-2008
     <br/>
     - CVS loaded with updated finite state machine (bug fixes for interrupts)
     <br/>
     - Include an example for specification (copied from cpu6502_tc - on working)
     <br/>
     Aug-05-2008
     <br/>
     - CVS loaded with BETA source files (VHDL)
