     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     With the M2G protocol a high performance, very scalable and easy to implement multi media transport system for in car use shall be defined. Inspired by the MOST protocol (Media Oriented Systems Transport) (
     
      http://www.mostcooperation.com)
     
     but with many innovative improvements it shall be proved that with already existing technologies a far higher bandwidth for in car communication is possible.
     <br/>
     Any OEM (car manufacturer) and Tier1 are welcome to participate in this project and to support my work. If you find mistakes in my documentation inform me, please.

     Goals
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Goals">
     MOST currently specifies three different speed grades: 25, 50 and 150 Mbps (INIC25..INIC150 chips). By adoption of existing high speed data transmission technologies like PCIe, SATAII, USB3 and RapidIO it is expected to boost this bandwidth beyond 2 Gbps independent whether fiber optics or copper transmission lines are used.
     <br/>
     Additionally the following demands must be kept in mind:
     <br/>
     * open protocol spec
     <br/>
     * scalable from 150 Mbps up to above 3 Gbps
     <br/>
     * support for 44.1, 48 or 96kHz frame rate
     <br/>
     * tunnelling of other bus systems like Ethernet or DTCP
     <br/>
     * independent from transmission media (optical or copper; DC free)
     <br/>
     * reuse of existing M messaging software
     <br/>
     * CDR (clock data recovery), source synchronous or oversampling possible
     <br/>
     * for FPGA and ASIC
     <br/>
     * dynamic bandwidth usage
     <br/>
     * save and deterministic arbitration mechanisms
     <br/>
     * protecting the ECU controller from high bandwidths streams and high event rates
     <br/>
     * EMI reduction (e.g. data scrambling and error detection/recovery)
     <br/>
