     This Module is EPP v1.9 and can communicate with a computer parallel port. It is memory less module and has got two bits to tell the module user about the arrival of data either address or data from Pc and when module user wants to transmitt the data he has to place the required bits i.e send_data bits to appropriate value and place the data in address or data register. The module has a special mode in which it forst transmitt the address to PC and than Data. The three spare bits are used to tell the PC about the data whether it is address or data and also it sets spare3 bit when it has get data from PC and when that data is removed by the module user than it will reset that spare3 bit.
