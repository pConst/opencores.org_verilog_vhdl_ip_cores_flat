     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     This project, written in generic synthesizable VHDL, provides two separate cores for encoding and decoding byte data according to the 8b/10b protocol. 8b/10b is widely used in high speed serial communication standards that need a run-length limited, DC balanced data stream for reliable data transmission and clock recovery. The encoder accepts a parallel 8-bit raw input and generates a parallel 10-bit encoded value based on the data along with a running disparity value. The decoder does the reverse, providing a decoded 8-bit value from the 10-bit encoded input. These cores can be easily incorporated into serializer/deserializer (serdes) communications applications.

     Features:
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features:">
     The two main modules provide a complete VHDL implementation that closely follows the original IBM article "A DC-Balanced, Partitioned-Block, 8B/10B Transmission Code" published by A.X. Widmer and P.A. Franaszek and the resulting US patent #4,486,739.  For clarity, the VHDL code references the figures and tables of the patent document.  Please note that the patent has now expired.
     <br/>
     Encoder:
     <br/>
     + 8b/10b Encoder (file: 8b10b_enc.vhd)
     <br/>
     + Synchronous clocked inputs (latched on each clock rising edge)
     <br/>
     + 8-bit parallel unencoded data input
     <br/>
     + KI input selects data or control encoding
     <br/>
     + Asynchronous active high reset initializes all logic
     <br/>
     + Encoded data output
     <br/>
     + 10-bit parallel encoded output valid 1 clock later
     <br/>
     Decoder:
     <br/>
     + 8b/10b Decoder (file: 8b10b_dec.vhd)
     <br/>
     + Synchronous clocked inputs (latched on each clock rising edge)
     <br/>
     + 10-bit parallel encoded data input
     <br/>
     + Asynchronous active high reset initializes all logic
     <br/>
     + Decoded data, disparity and KO outputs
     <br/>
     + 8-bit parallel unencoded output valid 1 clock later
     <br/>
     There are two Testbench files; one that tests the encoder and a second that drives the decoder with the latched output from the encoder.  All 256 data characters, "D", and all 12 control characters , "K", are sequenced.

     - Encoder Testbench (file: enc_8b10b_TB.vhd)
     <br/>
     - Combined Testbench (file: endec_8b10b_TB.vhd)
