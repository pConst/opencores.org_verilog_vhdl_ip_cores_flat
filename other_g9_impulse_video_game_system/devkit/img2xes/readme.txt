    img2xes converts image files into hexadecimal data files in the XES
    format. These hex files can be downloaded into the memory on an XS Board
    and displayed on a VGA monitor.

    img2xes requires a perl interpreter for its execution. You can get a
    free perl interpreter for Windows at www.activestate.com. You already
    have a perl interpreter if you are running linux, solaris or unix.

    img2xes requires the *netpbm* suite of image conversion programs in
    order to convert the various image file formats. You can get these from
    http://netpbm.sourceforge.net. Once installed, you need to place the
    *netpbm* directory in your path or store it directly in the
    $netpbm_bin_dir variable in img2xes.pl.

    You can test img2xes to see if it is working by executing the test_img2xes.cmd
    command file.  The file that is created should match the one that is
    included in this archive.

    READ THE MANUAL PAGE FOR THIS PROGRAM FOR MORE INFORMATION AND EXAMPLES.
    Read the img2xes.pl Perl script for details on how the program works.
