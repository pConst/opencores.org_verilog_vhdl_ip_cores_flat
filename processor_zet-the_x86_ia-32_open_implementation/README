Quick help
----------
The most important file is "impl/virtex4-ml403ep/syn/kotku.v" as is the
top level module for the complete SOC system.

For building the system (Xilinx tools must be installed):
$ source /opt/Xilinx/10.1/ISE/settings64.sh  # (or equivalent)
$ cd impl/virtex4-ml403ep/syn/
$ make

As a result, you will have a file named "kotku.bit", which is the conf-
iguration stream for the FPGA.


Explanation of directories
--------------------------
bin/   - Some scripts to prepare ROMs, download microcode, etc...
doc/   - Documentation stub
impl/  - Implementation dependent files (for different boards)
         currently one board supported: virtex4-ml403ep/
rtl-model/ - Zet processor RTL model
sim/   - Simulation scripts and testbenches
soc/   - Implementation independent files for the SOC system
src/   - Source files for some commands used to transform ROMs
tests/ - 8086 test benches (exactly the same as in the web)
