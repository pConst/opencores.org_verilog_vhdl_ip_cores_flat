INSTRUCTIONS OF USE:

1- Compiling the sources:

The sc2v translator is based on lex and yacc tools. You need lex and yacc
installed before trying to compile sc2v.

For compiling the sources just type "make" under the directory you unzipped the
fonts. It will generate three executables: sc2v_step1 and sc2v_step2 sc2v_step3.


2- Translating an SystemC module:

To translate use sc2v.sh script in the /bin directory just writting sc2v.sh module_name

3- Format and restrictions of the SystemC files:
	
	- Each module must have a .h file with the declarations of ports,
	signals, and processes, and there must exist a .cpp file with the code
	of the processes.
	
	- For writing to a port or a signal you must ALWAYS use the .write()
	method.
	
	-Macros not fully supported.
	
	-Only data types: bool, sc_int, sc_bigint, sc_uint and sc_biguint are
	supported.
	
	-No global variables supported.
	
4- Known bugs

	-The usage of macros and defines may cause some errors.
		
5- For testing the application we recommend to use the systemcdes,systecaes and
systemcmd5 cores, available at www.opencores.org.


TODO:

	- Repair all known bugs.
	- Make macros fully supported.
