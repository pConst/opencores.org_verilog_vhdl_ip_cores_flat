     Fast binary counter, designed to minimize logic path length in between flip-flops
     <br/>
     to one gate (MUX/AND) only, at the expense of not so straightforward binary counting.

     Summary
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Summary">
     The reason for this design has emerged while using Actel (MicroSemi)
     <br/>
     ProASIC/IGLOO architecture, lacking any hardwired support for fast carry.
     <br/>
     During our work on Actel FPGAs (basically, 3-LUT &amp; DFF only), we were
     <br/>
     aware of following types of faster counters:
     <br/>
     - LFSR counter
     <br/>
     - Johnson counter
     <br/>
     - "RLA counter" (as tailored using Actel's SmartGen core generator)
     <br/>
     Johnson due to its O(2^n) (n as number of bits) can not be used for
     <br/>
     longer counts; LFSR's are hard to invert (table lookup seems to be
     <br/>
     only known method), therefore also impractical for wider counters. RLA
     <br/>
     counter is still too slow and complex for wider counters and moderate
     <br/>
     speeds (e.g.  &gt; 24bits @ &gt;100MHz).
     <br/>
     As a consequence, the proposed counter uses synchronous divide-by-two
     <br/>
     blocks, each using 1-bit pipeline and carry by single-clock
     <br/>
     pulse. Design is simple and fast, preliminary results from Synplify
     <br/>
     and Actel Designer shows 32bits @200MHz feasible.
     <br/>
     However, output bit lines are non-proportionaly delayed by discrete
     <br/>
     number of clock periods. Therefore, to obtain linear bit word, an
     <br/>
     inversion formula needs to be applied. Fortunately, the inversion is
     <br/>
     simple (unlike LFSR's), in C (pcount.c):
     <br/>
     for (k = 1; k &lt; n; k++)
     <br/>
     if ((y &amp; ((1&lt;&lt;k)-1))       y = y ^ (1&lt;&lt;k);
     <br/>
     -- it may be implemented in VHDL core, or within CPU as shown, depending on
     <br/>
     application requirements.

     If you find this idea useful, apply it whenever you want, however,
     <br/>
     share your improvements. E.g.:
     <br/>
     - (fast) HDL implementation of bitword encode/decode
     <br/>
     - preset/reset/match/enable logic
     <br/>
     Testimonials (usage/frequency/bits/architecture) are indeed welcome.
