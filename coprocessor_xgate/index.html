     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     The Xgate Co-processor Module, Xgate, is a 16 bit programmable RISC processor that is managed by a host CPU to reduce the host load in handling interrupts.  Because the Xgate is user programmable there is a great deal of user control in how to preprocess data from peripheral modules. The module may be configured as a simple DMA controller to organize data such that the host only deals with whole messages and not individual words or bytes. The Xgate may also deal with higher levels of messaging protocols than the peripheral hardware recognizes. Encryption algorithms are also supported by the instruction set.
