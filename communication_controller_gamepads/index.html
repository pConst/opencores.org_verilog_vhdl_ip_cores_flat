    <p>
     This project contains a collection of cores that interface with various gamepads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each gamepad type has a dedicated controller core which handles the communication with one or more pads of the same type. The status of the buttons together with information about the pad axes is provided by a simple interface.
Systems integrating such a core can monitor this interface via general purpose IO lines.

     The project has beta status. This means that not all cores and features have been used under all possible conditions.
The SNESpad and the basic flavor of the GCpad are heavily used in several FPGA implementations. The full flavor of GCpad is only verified inside the core's testbench. It has not seen in-depth use in real hardware so far.
