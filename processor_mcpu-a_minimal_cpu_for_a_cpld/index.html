    <p id="p_MCPU - Minimal CPU for a 32 Macrocell CPLD">
     MCPU is a minimal cpu aimed to fit into a 32 Macrocell CPLD - one of the smallest available programmable logic devices. While this CPU is not powerful enough for real world applications it has proven itself as a valuable educational tool. The source code is just a single page and easily understood. Both VHDL and Verilog versions are supplied. The package comes with assembler, emulator and extensive documentation.
     <br/>
     Please let me know if you find a good use for this CPU and put your project/publication/lecture notes on the web. I will try to maintain a list here. I know it already has found good use for many purposes.

    <p id="p_Features">
     The CPU is accumulator based and supports a bare minimum of registers. The accumulator has a width of eight bits and is complemented by a carry flag. The program counter (PC) has a width of six bits which allows addressing of 64 eight bit words of memory. The memory is shared between program code and data.
