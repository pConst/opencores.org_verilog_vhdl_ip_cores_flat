      Please if you are using this core, report if the marked bugs (CPHA='1', bit alignment) are solved for your toolchain.

      I have confirmation from people using Xilinx ISE 13.1, 12.4 and 12.1 with WebPack, Altium + ISE 12.3, Synopsys and Altera tools.
      <br/>
      I would like to know if the VHDL style used in this core works for your toolchain, and if not, what seems to be the problem.
      <br/>
      My goal is to find a description style that is as friendly as possible to synthesis tools.

     The scope screens below show a CPOL=1, CPHA=1 spi transaction. Debug signals show the slave internal state and slave flow control signals for the read/write ports. The spi_master and spi_slave cores are verified in FPGA hardware at 100MHz (50MHz spi clock) with 0 ns of SCK-to-MOSI delay and less than 2ns of SCK-to-MISO delay.
     <br/>
     In the example, the slave is used with wren_i permanently tied to HIGH. The parallel input data is sampled from di_i at start of transmission, until the first SPI SCK edge. For continuous transfers, the data at di_i is sampled again every falling edge on state 1.

     The scope screens below show 2 examples of continuous transfers: for CPOL=1, CPHA=0 and CPOL=0, CPHA=0 spi modes. The words are loaded when 'di_req' line goes to '1'. Data is presented to the port di_i and wren_i is pulsed to write the data word.&#160;
     <div class="u_line">
     </div>
     In the screen on the right, the 1st 'di_req' data request (requesting data for the second word) is ignored by the slave parallel interface driver, and MISO is cleared (others =&gt; '0') for that word. The 3rd word is loaded normally ('wren' is strobed in time for the transfer).

     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     This project started from the need to have robust yet simple SPI interface cores written in VHDL to use in generic FPGA-to-device interfacing.
     <br/>
     The resulting cores generate small and efficient circuits, that operate from very slow SPI clocks up to over 50MHz SPI clocks.
     <br/>
     The project contains 2 independent cores: SPI_MASTER and SPI_SLAVE.
     <br/>
     Both cores are written in VHDL, with fully pipelined RTL architecture and separate clock domains for the SPI bus clock and parallel I/O interface.
     <br/>
     The design is originally targeted to a Spartan-6 device, but is written in fully synthesizable, technology-independent VHDL.
     <br/>
     The circuits preserve FPGA clock resources by directly using the system high speed clock for all flops, with clock enables (CE) to clock registers.
     <br/>
     The master and slave cores were verified in hardware using the Digilent Atlys board (Spartan-6 @100MHz) with spi clocks from 500kHz to 50MHz SPI clock, with perfect phasing and very robust operation.
     <br/>
     If you find these cores useful, please let me know: jdoin@opencores.org
     <br/>
     If you find the LGPL license to be unfit for your purposes, please let me know and we can change the license for another open-source hardware license that can be integrated in your application.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - VHDL core, fully synchronous, designed with classic RTL pipelined architecture, with a single high-speed global clock
     <br/>
     - Very small and efficient SPI interface
     <br/>
     - Parameterizable at instantiation by generics: (N, CPOL, CPHA, PREFETCH, SPI_2X_CLK_DIV)
     <br/>
     -&gt; SPI modes (CPOL, CPHA): supports modes 0,1,2,3
     <br/>
     -&gt; Word width (N): from 8 bits to synthesis limit (accepts any word length)
     <br/>
     -&gt; Lookahead input data request (PREFETCH): pipelined data request for back-to-back data transmission
     <br/>
     -&gt; SPI 2x clock divider value from the high-speed system clock
     <br/>
     - Very economic: no FIFO, just a registered parallel output buffer for received data
     <br/>
     - Parallel read/write similar to synchronous RAM ports
     <br/>
     - Independent clock domains for the serial bus and parallel read/write ports with async domain transfer pipelines
     <br/>
     - Can be used to control generic SPI devices (master), or as interface to MCUs (slave)
     <br/>
     - Vendor-independent, fully LUT/FF design, uses no Xilinx-specific structures, IOBs or shift registers
     <br/>
     - Synthesizes to +210MHz in a Spartan-6 lowest grade, using only CLB logic
     <br/>
     - Verified in silicon, with a 100MHz clock, using SPI frequencies from 500kHz up to 50MHz in a Spartan-6 XC6SLX45-2
     <br/>
     - Very small: 41 slices for 2 ports (a master interface + a slave interface) with 32bits of word length
