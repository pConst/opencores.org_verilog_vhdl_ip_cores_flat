     Code Summary
     <br/>
     ------------
     <br/>
     This module implements the baseline profile of the H.264 video codec standard.
     <br/>
     It supports video resolution up to 1080p.  It is capable of decoding video at 60 frames per
     <br/>
     second (typically more) at any supported resolution.  The design has been
     <br/>
     synthesized in 180nm technology.  At 100 mHz it requires approximately 4
     <br/>
     square millimeters.
     <br/>
     Lower resolution decoding (720p @ 30 fps) requires approxiamately half the implementation area.
     <br/>
     It should be noted that there are some error resiliency features that are not implemented:
     <br/>
     *   Flexible macroblock ordering
     <br/>
     *   Arbitrary Slice Ordering
     <br/>
     *   Redundant Slices
     <br/>
     These are intended to be used when streaming video over unreliable
     <br/>
     channels, but they don't seem to be commonly supported.
     <br/>
     Directory layout
     <br/>
     ----------------
     <br/>
     release -
     <br/>
     This directory contains the released H.264 source.
     <br/>
     test -
     <br/>
     This directory contains the build and test infrastructure.  Building the
     <br/>
     source requires that the Bluespec compiler (bsc) in your executable path.
     <br/>
     The code has been tested on the lastest 2007 release.  Future releases may
     <br/>
     or may not build a functional version of the code.  To build the
     <br/>
     code type in the test directory:
     <br/>
     make release
     <br/>
     Testing infrastructure is included in the release.  The golden software code
     <br/>
     requires g++ 4.1.  It will not compile with g++ 4.0 or earlier.  Further,
     <br/>
     the included software model does not correctly decode 1080p resolution
     <br/>
     and possibly other smaller resolutions.  Ignore reported decoding errors
     <br/>
     at this resolution.  Alternatively, you could manually check against the
     <br/>
     orignal source image.  If you want to run the included test cases, type the
     <br/>
     following command:
     <br/>
     ./test.pl
     <br/>
     This command will build the hardware and attempt to decode a number of
     <br/>
     sample encoded videos of various resolutions, reporting results as it
     <br/>
     decodes.  The testbench takes several hours to run to completion.

     Documentation
     <br/>
     -------------
     <br/>
     Refer to the source (kind of spotty) and the following URL:

     <br/>
     This document contains many useful diagrams and a good description of the
     <br/>
     behavior of the system.
