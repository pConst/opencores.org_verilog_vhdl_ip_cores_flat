     Core Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Core Description">
     As the name suggests the CORDIC algorithm was developed for rotating coordinates, a piece of hardware for doing real-time navigational computations in the 1950's. The CORDIC uses a sequence like successive approximation to reach its results. The nice part is it does this by adding/subtracting and shifting only.

Suppose we want to rotate a point(X,Y) by an angle(Z). The coordinates for the new point(Xnew, Ynew) are:
     <ul>
      Xnew = X * cos(Z) - Y * sin(Z)
Ynew = Y * cos(Z) + X * sin(Z)
     </ul>
     Or rewritten:
     <ul>
      Xnew / cos(Z) = X - Y * tan(Z)
Ynew / cos(Z) = Y + X * tan(Z)
     </ul>
     It is possible to break the angle into small pieces, such that the tangents of these pieces are always a power of 2. This results in the following equations:
     <ul>
      X(n+1) = P(n) * ( X(n) - Y(n) / 2^n)
Y(n+1) = P(n) * ( Y(n) + X(n) / 2^n)
Z(n) = atan(1/2^n)
     </ul>
     The atan(1/2^n) has to be pre-computed, because the algorithm uses it to approximate the angle. The P(n) factor can be eliminated from the equations by pre-computing its final result. If we multiply all P(n)'s together we get the aggregate constant.
     <ul>
      P = cos(atan(1/2^0)) * cos(atan(1/2^1)) * cos(atan(1/2^2))....cos(atan(1/2^n))
     </ul>
     This is a constant which reaches 0.607... Depending on the number of iterations and the number of bits used. The final equations look like this:
     <ul>
      Xnew = 0.607... * sum( X(n) - Y(n) / 2^n)
Ynew = 0.607... * sum( Y(n) + X(n) / 2^n)
     </ul>
     Now it is clear how we can simply implement this algorithm, it only uses shifts and adds/subs. Or in a program-like style:
     <ul>
      For i=0 to n-1
      <ul>
       If (Z(n) &gt;= 0) then
       <ul>
        X(n + 1) := X(n) &#8211; (Yn/2^n);
Y(n + 1) := Y(n) + (Xn/2^n);
Z(n + 1) := Z(n) &#8211; atan(1/2^i);
       </ul>
       Else
       <ul>
        X(n + 1) := X(n) + (Yn/2^n);
Y(n + 1) := Y(n) &#8211; (Xn/2^n);
Z(n + 1) := Z(n) + atan(1/2^i);
       </ul>
       End if;
      </ul>
      End for;
     </ul>
     Where 'n' represents the number of iterations.
