    <p id="p_Description">
     This is a Verilog implementation of the
     
      XTEA block cipher
     
     . It works on two 32-bit blocks of data at a time with a 128-bit key.

A proper OpenCores specification for this unit will be written at some point.
     
      Wishbone
     
     compliance is also on the TODO list.

This implementation was adapted from the public domain C release of the algorithm from David Wheeler and Roger Needham by
     
      David Johnson
     
     . It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

     The current stable release is version 1.0.

This release has seperate encipher/decipher units. A test-bench is available and included in the download. Version 1.0 is not licensed under the LGPL - it is public domain.

Each unit accepts data in data_in1 and data_in2 and a key in key_in. The all_done wire is raised when the results of the operation are ready to be read from data_out1 and data_out2.  They need to be reset before each use.

This release has been FPGA-proven on an Altera Stratix EPS1S10F672C6-ES running at 25.175MHz. Higher clock speeds have not been tested.

Please report back if you get the design up-and-running (especially if you get it running as an ASIC) or if you have it running at a higher clock speed.

     the download page doesn't appear to be working at the moment, but you can
     
      grab the release from CVS

     Originally the project was split into seperate encipher/decipher units, but these have now been combined into a single unit. The test-bench has not yet been updated for the new combined unit.

The unit accepts data in data_in1 and data_in2, a key in key_in and the mode in mode (1 for encipher, 0 for decipher). The all_done wire is raised when the results of the operation are ready to be read from data_out1 and data_out2. It needs to be reset before each use.

This combined unit, as of yet, has
