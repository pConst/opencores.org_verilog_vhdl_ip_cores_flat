     CONNECT-6 SOLVER
    </h2>
    <p id="p_CONNECT-6 SOLVER">
     Connect-6 is usually played on a 19 &#215; 19 GO Board, with each player having either black or
     <br/>
     white pieces. The Black starts the game with only one move, and after that each player makes
     <br/>
     two moves at a time. The game stops when one of the player forms a vertical, horizontal or
     <br/>
     diagonal line connecting six pieces of his color, or the board is full.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The fact that makes this game more interesting, is that each player makes two moves at a time,
     <br/>
     except for the first move. This considerably increases the search space for moves and end-games.
     <br/>
     Because of these reasons, Connect-6 has gained popularity in the AI community, and has been included
     <br/>
     in the Computer Olympiad.
     <br/>
     In this project we synthesize an open source connect-6 program( available at
     
      http://risujin.org/connectk/)
     
     <br/>
     into hardware using HLS tools.

     <br/>
     DEMO:
     <br/>
     Before you begin exploring the project you can find demo files in the DEMO folder, which contains the original connect-k player, the bitstream for DE2 Board from ALTERA.
     <br/>
     Download DE2.sof into the altera DE2 board, and connect it to your PC with RS232 cable.
     <br/>
     Launch connectk and choose "serial port " in the drop down menu for players.
     <br/>
     it should be able to play with the DE2 board now.
     <br/>
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     <br/>
     BUILD_SCC:
     <br/>
     In this folder you can run the complete build flow for synphonycc.
     <br/>
     Install SYNPHONYCC, and QUARTUS, change the MaKefile so that the variable SCC point to your installation.
     <br/>
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     <br/>
     Make Targets:
     <br/>
     make: This will compile the golden "C" code (synthesizable) and run a test.
     <br/>
     make synth: This will run the SCC flow, and generate RTL(verilog) which can be found in the folder rtl_package.
     <br/>
     make altera_synth: This will generate the bitstream for DE2 board "DE2.sof". it depends on the previous target.
     <br/>
     make fpga: This runs the complete flow downto testing the board.
     <br/>
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     <br/>
     folders:
     <br/>
     BUILD_SRC/synth_src: contains the synthesizable "C/C++" code, which is a modified version of original source code found in
     <br/>
     CONNECTK folder.
     <br/>
     BUILD_SRC/scc_scripts: contains the scripts for scc, whic are used when you do make synth.
     <br/>
     DE2: Contains the wrapper code, pin assignments etc. for the DE2 board.
