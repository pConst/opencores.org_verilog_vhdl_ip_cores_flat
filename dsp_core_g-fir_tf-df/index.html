    <p id="p_Description">
     This is an elementary generic structural VHDL code for FIR digital filters in transposed-form and direct-form implementations.
     <br/>
     This project covers a wide spectrum of design aspects, in particular design and both functional and formal verification.
     <br/>
     The project is developed in VHDL and modeled in SystemC. The SystemC model is used for functional and formal verification.
     <br/>
     TCL scripts for GHDL and SystemC is included within the project files.
     <br/>
     This code could be considered for VHDL classes or DSP classes for amateurs or beginners.
     <br/>
     The developed code was synthesized for FPGA and ASIC (0.13um CMOS) using:
     <br/>
     Xilinx 		ISE
     <br/>
     Synopsys 	Design Compiler
     <br/>
     Cadende 	RTL Encounter
     <br/>
     Further, it was implemented using Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA utilizing the Spartan-3E Starter Kit. It was tested using Xilinx ChipScope and a complete lab setup, as well. The filter output was converted to analog output using the on-board DAC to trace it on a Spectrum analyser.
