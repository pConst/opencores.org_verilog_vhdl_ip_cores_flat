Unlike most other PDP-11 software xxdp was not sold to Mentec.
By now, ownership of xxdp software is in the hands of HP.

PDP-11 customers were not required to sign a license agreement for xxdp,
the software was provided with the system or brought to the customer site 
by a Field Service representative.

Bottom line is that there is certainly a copyright on the xxdp software,
but as it seems not a license.
