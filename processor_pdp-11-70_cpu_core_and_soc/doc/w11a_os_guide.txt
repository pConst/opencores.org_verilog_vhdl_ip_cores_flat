1. I/O emulation setup ----------------------------------------------------

   All UNIBUS peripherals which exchange data (currently DL11, LP11, PC11, RK11,
   and RL11) are currently emulated via a backend process. The communication 
   between FPGA board and backend server can be via

   - Serial port
     - via an integrated USB-UART bridge
       - on basys3 and nexys4 with a FT2232HQ, allows up to 12M Baud
       - on nexys3 with a FT232R, allows up to 2M Baud
     - via RS232 port, as on s3board and nexys2
       - using a serial port (/dev/ttySx) is limited to 115 kBaud on most PCs.
       - using a USB-RS232 adapter was tested up to 460k Baud. 
   
   - Direct USB connection using a Cypress FX2 USB controller
     - is supported on the nexys2 and nexys3 FPGA boards
     - much faster than serial port connections (see below)
     - also allows to configure the FPGA over the same USB connection

   Notes: 
   - A 10M Baud connection, like on a nexys4, gives disk access rates and 
     throughputs much better than the real hardware of the 70's and is well 
     suitable for practical usage.
   - In an OS with good disk caching like 2.11BSD the impact of disk speed
     is actually smaller than the bare numbers suggest.
   - A 460k Baud connection gives in practice a disk throughput of ~20 kB/s. 
     This allows to test the system but is a bit slow for real usage.
   - USB-RS232 cables with a FTDI FT232R chip work fine, tests with Prolific 
     Technology PL2303 based cable never gave reliable connections for higher 
     Baud rates.

   Recommended setup for best performance (boards ordered by vintage):

       Board   Channel/Interface      nom. speed      peak transfer rate

      basys3   USB-UART bridge        10M Baud              910 kB/sec
      nexys4   USB-UART bridge        10M Baud              910 kb/sec
      nexys3   Cypress FX2 USB        USB2.0 speed        30000 kB/sec
      nexys2   Cypress FX2 USB        USB2.0 speed        30000 kB/sec
     s3board   RS232+USB-RS232 cable  460k Baud              41 kB/sec
    
2. FPGA Board setup -------------------------------------------------------

   Recommended setups

   - Basys3
     - connect USB cable to micro-USB connector labeled 'PROG'
     - to configure via vivado hardware server
         make <sys>.vconfig

   - Nexys4
     - connect USB cable to micro-USB connector labeled 'PROG'
     - to configure via vivado hardware server
         make <sys>.vconfig

   - Nexys3
     - use Cypress FX for configure and and rlink communication
     - connect USB cable to micro-USB connector labeled 'USB PROG'
     - to configure via FX2 and jtag tool
         make <sys>.jconfig

   - Nexys2
     - connect USB cable to mini-USB connector (between RS232 and PS/2 port)
     - to configure via FX2 and jtag tool
         make <sys>.jconfig

   - S3board
     - connect the USB-RS232 cable to the RS232 port
     - connect a JTAG programmer (e.g. Xilinx USB Cable II) to JTAG pins
     - to configure via ISE Impact
         make <sys>.iconfig

3. Rlink and Backend Server setup -----------------------------------------

   All examples below use the same basic setup

   - setup vt100 emulator windows

       cd $RETROBASE/tools/oskit/<oskit-name>
       console_starter -d DL0 &
       console_starter -d DL1 &

   - setup rlink connection using ti_rri backend server via the ti_w11 
     quick start wrapper script. Ensure that all 8 switches on the board
     are in the indicated positions (SWI=...). The concrete boot script
     name <boot-script> is given in the following sections

     - for b3 over serial
         SWI = 00000000 00101010
         ti_w11 -tu<dn>,10M,break,xon  @<oskit-name>_boot.tcl

         NOTE: the basys3 w11a has only 176 kB memory (all from BRAMS!)
               unix-v5 works fine. XXDP, RT11 and RSX-11M should work.
               211bsd will not boot, either most RSX-11M+ systems.

     - for n4 over serial
         SWI = 00000000 00101000
         ti_w11 -tu<dn>,10M,break,cts  @<oskit-name>_boot.tcl

     - for n2,n3 over fx2
         SWI = 00101100
         ti_w11 -u @<oskit-name>_boot.tcl

     - for s3 serial
         SWI = 00101010
         ti_w11 -tu<dn>,460k,break,xon @<oskit-name>_boot.tcl
   
     Notes: 
     - on <dn>, the serial device number
       - check with 'ls /dev/ttyUSB*' to see what is available
       - <dn> is typically '1' if only a single basys3 or nexys4 is connected
         Initially two ttyUSB devices show up, the lower is for FPGA config
         and will disappear when Vivado hardware server is used once. The
         upper provides the data connection.
       - <dn> is typically '0' if only a single USB-RS232 cable is connected

     - on LED display
       - is controlled by SWI(3)
           0 -> system status
           1 -> DR emulation --> OS specific light patterns

     - on Hex display
       - is controlled by SWI(5:4)
       - boards with a 4 digit display
           00 -> serial link rate divider
           01 -> PC
           10 -> DISPREG
           11 -> DR emulation
       - boards with 8 digit display
         - SWI(5) select for DSP(7:4) display
             0 -> serial link rate divider
             1 -> PC
         - SWI(4) select for DSP(3:0) display
             0 -> DISPREG
             1 -> DR emulation

4. simh simulator setup ---------------------------------------------------

   Sometimes it is good to compare the w11a behaviour with the PDP-11 software
   emulator from the simh project (see http://simh.trailing-edge.com/).

   Under $RETROBASE/tools/simh two setup files are provided with configure
   simh to reflect the w11a setup as close as possible:
   - setup_w11a_min.scmd
     Very close the current w11a state when it runs on an s3board
     - processor: 11/70, no FPP, 1 Mbyte
     - periphery:   2 DL11, LP11, RK11, PC11
   - setup_w11a_max.scmd
     Planned configuration for the w11a, in addition
     - processor: 4 Mbyte memory (as on Nexys2, Nexys3,...)
     - periphery: DZ11, RL11/RL02, RK70/RP06, TM11/TU10

   Startup scripts are provided with each oskit. They call the w11a_max
   configuration, so will show in the emulator what w11a can do when
   finished.

   All examples below use the same basic setup

   - setup vt100 emulator window for 2nd DL11

       cd $RETROBASE/tools/oskit/<oskit-name>
       console_starter -s -d DL1 &

       {Note: the -s ensures that the port numbers used by simh are taken!}

   - start the simulator

     pdp11 <oskit-name>_boot.scmd

5. oskits -----------------------------------------------------------------

   Ready to be used 'oskits' are provided under
     $RETROBASE/tools/oskit/<oskit-name>

   The tarballs with the disk images are provided from a web server
   and have to be installed separately.

5a. Unix systems -----------------------------------------------------

   Legal and license issues:

     Ancient UNIX systems for the PDP-11 can now be freely used under the
     'Caldera license'. 2.11BSD was released 1992 under the 4 clause BSD 
     license. Taken together

       - Unix V1 to V7
       - all BSD Unix versions for PDP-11

     can be freely distributed and used for non-commercial purposes.   

   Several oskits are provided:

     - unix-v5_rk: Unix V5 System on RK05

     - 211bsd_rk:  2.11BSD system on RK05  (very elementary subset)
     - 211bsd_rl:  2.11BSD system on RL02  (small subset)
     - 211bsd_rp:  2.11BSD system on RP06  (full system)

   For further details consult the README_<oskit-name>set.txt file in the
   oskit directory.

5b. DEC operating systems --------------------------------------------
   
   Legal and license issues:

     Unfortunately there is no general hobbyist license for DEC operating 
     systems for PDP-11 computers. The 'Mentec license' is commonly understood 
     to cover the some older versions of DEC operating systems, for example
       - RT-11 V5.3 or prior
       - RSX-11M V4.3 or prior
       - RSX-11M PLUS V3.0 or prior
     on a simulator. It is commonly assumed that the license terms cover the
     usage of the PDP11 simulator from the 'simh' suite. Usage of the e11
     simulator is not covered according to the author of e11.

     HOWEVER: THIS LICENSE DOES NOT COVER THE USAGE OF THESE HISTORIC DEC 
              OPERATING SYSTEMS ON ANY 'REAL HARDWARE' IMPLEMENTATION OF A 
              PDP-11. SO USAGE ON THE W11 IS *NOT* COVERED BY THE 
              'Mentec-license'. 

   Some oskits are provided with systems sysgen'ed to run on a configuration 
   like the w11a.

   - Feel free to explore them with the simh simulator.
     The boot scripts for simh are included ( <kit>.simh )
   
   - In case you happen to have a valid license feel free to try them
     out the W11A and let the author know whether is works as it should.
     For convenience the boot scripts are also included ( <kit>.tcl ).

   Several oskits are provided:

     - rsx11m-31_rk:   RSX-11M V3.1    on RK05
     - rsx11m-40_rk:   RSX-11M V4.0    on RK05

     - rsx11mp-30_rp:  RSX-11M+ V3.0   on RP06

     - rt11-40_rk:     RT-11 V4.0      on RK05
     - rt11-53_rl:     RT-11 V5.3      on RL02

     - xxdp_rl:        XXDP 22 and 25  on RL02

   For further details consult the README_<oskit-name>set.txt file in the
   oskit directory.
