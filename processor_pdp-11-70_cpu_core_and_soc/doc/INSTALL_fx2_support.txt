The Nexys2 and Nexys3 board feature a Cypress FX2 USB interface. It allows
to configure the FPGA and to transfer between FPGA and a PC. The retro
project uses a custom firmware in the FX2, this writeup describes the
installation of tools, environment setup and generation of the FX2 firmware.

  2.  Setup environment variables
  3.  Setup USB access
  4.  Rebuild Cypress FX2 firmware

1. System requirements ----------------------------------------------------
  
  - the download contains pre-build firmware images for the Cypress FX2
    USB Interface. Re-building them requires
    - Small Device C Compiler
      -> package: sdcc sdcc-ucsim

  - for FX2 firmware download and jtag programming over USB one needs
    - fxload
      -> package: fxload
    - urjtag
      -> package: urjtag   for Ubuntu 12.04
      -> see INSTALL_urjtag.txt for other distributions !!

2. Setup environment variables ---------------------------------------------

  The default USB VID and PID is defined by two environment variables. 
  For internal lab use one can use

    export RETRO_FX2_VID=16c0
    export RETRO_FX2_PID=03ef

  !! Carefully read the disclaimer about usage of USB VID/PID numbers  !!
  !! in the file README_USB-VID-PID.txt. You'll be responsible for any !!
  !! misuse of the defaults provided with the project sources.         !!
  !! Usage of this VID/PID in any commercial product is forbidden.     !!

3. Setup USB access -------------------------------------------------------

  For using the Cypress FX2 USB interface on Digilent Nexys2, Nexys3 and
  Atlys boards 'udev' rules must be setup to allow user level access to
  these devices. A set of rules is provided under

    $RETROBASE/tools/fx2/sys

  Follow the 'README.txt' file in this directory.

  Notes:
  - the provided udev rules use the VID/PID for 'internal lab use' as
    described above. If other VID/PID used the file must be modified.
  - your user account must be in group 'plugdev' (should be the default).

4. Rebuild Cypress FX2 firmware -------------------------------------------

  The download includes pre-build firmware images for the Cypress FX2
  USB interface used on the Digilent Nexys2, Nexys3 and Atlys Boards.
  These firmware images are under

    $RETROBASE/tools/fx2/bin

  To re-build them, e.g. because a different USB VID/PID is to be used

    cd $RETROBASE/tools/fx2/src
    make clean
    make
    make install

  Note: The default build assumes that sdcc with a version 3.x is installed.
        In case sdcc 2.x is installed use
           make SDCC29=1
        instead. See also tools/fx2/src/README.txt in the 

  Please read README_USB_VID-PID.txt carefully to understand the usage
  of USB VID and PID.
