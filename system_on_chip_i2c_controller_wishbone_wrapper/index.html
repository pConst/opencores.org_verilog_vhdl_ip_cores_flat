    <p id="p_Description">
     Short: virtually convert an I2C slave into a WISHBONE slave
     <br/>
     This is a wrapper for the I2C controller core by Richard Herveille (
     
      http://opencores.org/project,i2c)
     
     which transparently converts a WISHBONE transaction into an I2C operation.
     <br/>
     Example: a WB read/write of the WB address 09h of this core would schedule and execute the (long) list of commands needed to make an I2C read/write of reg 09h of an I2C device connected to the I2C controller core in OpenCores, and return the result transparently into the WB bus.
     <br/>
     IMPORTANT: The current wrapper is for 16 bits I2C slaves, that is I2C reads and writes are composed of two bytes.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - WISHBONE wrapper for the "I2C controller core" by Richard Herveille
     <br/>
     - Fully transparent I2C  WISHBONE operation
     <br/>
     - A WB read/write of address X becomes an I2C read/write of reg. X and the I2C slave's response is sent back to the WB bus.
     <br/>
     - Designed for 16 bits I2C slaves
     <br/>
     - FPGA proven and works perfect (if you run into problems: take into account this I2C controller's bug solution:
     
      http://www.opencores.org/ptracker.cgi/view/i2c/370
     
     )
     <br/>
     - Limitations: the I2C slave's address is fixed, so that it may be used to control only one slave (can be overriden with minor modifications).
