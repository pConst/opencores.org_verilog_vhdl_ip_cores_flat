     About the uTosNet project
    </h2>
    <p id="p_About the uTosNet project">
     uTosNet (pronounced microTosNet) is developed at the University of Southern Denmark ( http://www.sdu.dk ), and is intended to:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Reduce the development time of experimental robotic controllers to arrive faster and cheaper at fully working demonstrations of new technology and concepts.
      </li>
      <li>
       Increase the reusability of experimental systems and components, thus increasing the life-span and utilization of these, and reducing the amount of redundant work.
      </li>
      <li>
       Ease the use of interacting with experimental low-level controller, to open experimental robotics up to a wider audience, and to allow high-level developers a tighter integration with the physical robots, without involving them in the low-level particulars of embedded systems.
      </li>
     </ul>
     Until now uTosNet has only been used inhouse for a number of projects. We would very much like to get feedback, opinions, ideas and comments from others though - anything will be appreciated!
     <br/>
     Also have a look at
     
      TosNet
     
     for the full-blown, multi-node version of TosNet.

     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     The uTosNet framework aims at providing a very fast method for interfacing physical components, such as motor drivers, ADCs, encoders, and similar, to applications on a PC.
     <br/>
     The framework is based on the Node-on-Chip architecture (link to paper coming).
     <br/>
     It works by utilizing a dual-port BlockRam in the FPGA, with one port exposed to access from the PC (through uTosNet) and the other port exposed to access from user-defined modules. This allows easy and generic storage of process variables.
     <br/>
     Currently two versions of uTosNet are supported:
     <ul>
      <li>
       PC side  USB  converter chip  UART  FPGA
      </li>
      <li>
       PC side  Ethernet  Digi Connect ME 9210 microcontroller module  SPI  FPGA
      </li>
     </ul>
     <br/>
     Note that the UART version does NOT include an implementation of a UART. It has however been prepared for use with the UART implementation from the PicoBlaze processor, which is available as a free download from Xilinx
     
      here
     
     .
