******************************************
* Description
******************************************
  The uTosNet commandline utility is meant for use with the Ethernet/SPI
  version of uTosNet. It provides a simple interface for reading and writing
  data from and to the shared memory block inside the FPGA.

******************************************
* Building
******************************************
  The uTosNet commandline utility uses the Qt framework (http://qt.nokia.com/)
  for crossplatform socket functionality. A working installation of Qt is thus
  necessary.
  Otherwise the utility itself is rather simple, and should work with most
  compilers.

  Run:
    qmake uTosNet_cmd.pro
    make release

******************************************
