    <p id="p_Description">
     The internal Logic state Analyser (LA) is a simplified version of a standard logic state analyzer, however it is build-in the prototyped circuit and therefore allows for probing internal signals. The LA at first writes probed signals into its internal memory, and then allows for off-line transfer through WISHBONE bus to a PC where the probed data can be watched. As during design prototyping watched signals are very often changed, the LA is mainly intended for FPGAs and works similarly to Xilinx ChipScope.
