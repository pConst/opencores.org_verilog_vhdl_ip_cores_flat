     10_100_1000 Mbps tri-mode ethernet MAC implements a MAC controller conforming to IEEE 802.3 specification. It is designed using less than 2000 LCs/LEs to implement full function. It will use inferred PADs to reduce technology dependancies. The whole project will be finished in TEN weeks inluding verilog coding,RTL level verification.
     <br/>
     A GUI configuration interface,created by tcl/tk script language,is convenient for configuring optional modules,FiFo depth and verifcation parameters. Furthermore,a verifcation system was designed with tcl/tk user interface,by which the stimulus can be generated automatically and the output packets can be verified with CRC-32 checksum.
