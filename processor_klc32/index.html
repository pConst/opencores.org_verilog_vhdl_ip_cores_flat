     KLC32 is a 32 bit non-pipelined processor. This project is in the first stage of it's evolution and has a long ways to go yet, hence descriptions are a bit lacking. Read the code. First coding was Oct 4, 2011.

     Programming Model
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Programming Model">
     There a 32 x 32 bit registers with register R0 always reads as zero.
     <br/>
     There are two processor modes, user and system, each with it's own stack pointer. Some instructions are restricted to system mode only.
     <br/>
     There is a group of eight condition code registers cr0 to cr7, each of which contains four status flags: carry,overflow,negative, and zero. The compare instruction can set any one of the group of condition codes.
     <br/>
     Many instructions update cr0 automatically.
     <br/>
     Two address modes are supported: register indirect with displacement, and indexed addressing.
