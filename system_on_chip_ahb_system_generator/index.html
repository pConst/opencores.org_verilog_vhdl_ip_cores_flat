     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     The intention is to provide an easy way to configure, create and simulate a "complete" AHB system.
     <br/>
     The main block is the "AHB matrix", in which every declared master has to be connected to one or more slaves.
     <br/>
     In order to test the connectivity of the matrix, and to evaluate performance tradeoffs between different architectural choises a configurable arbitration scheme and a "template" model of a parametrizable master and slave are provided.
     <br/>
     A complete testbench is also available to test the main write and read accesses made by every master to the slaves mapped on its address space.
     <br/>
     AHB system generator is a script which builds via GUI or file all .vhd files required to
     <br/>
     simulate the system: masters, slaves, arbiters, decoders, master and slave muxes.
     <br/>
     To run the AHB system generator you must have installed PERL and a GUI PERL module called Tk (see for example
     
      http://www.cpan.org/).
