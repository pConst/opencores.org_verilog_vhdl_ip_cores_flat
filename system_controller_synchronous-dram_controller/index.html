     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     The Synchronous-DRAM controller core allows any synchronous bus masters, such as most Intel microcontroller and x86 processors, to effortlessly interface to a large capacity SDRAM as though it were an SRAM. The core supports PC100 timing specifications.
     <br/>
     By default the core is configured to work with 512K x 2 Bank x 32-bit SDRAMs such as Samsung KM432S2030CT and Fujitsu MB81F643242B. Easy modifications allows the core to work with different capacity SDRAMs. Most of the critical parameters are defines in a global include file allowing easy reconfigurability of the core.
     <br/>
     The core handles much of the low level functions such as address multiplexing, refresh generation and busy status generation. In addtion, the non-trivial powerup initialization sequence is also handled transparently to the host. Flexible refresh generation permits burst refresh, normal refresh or everything in between. The SDRAM mode-register can also be reprogrammed on the fly by the host, although the core intializes the MRS with a default value. This value can be compile-time adjustable.
     <br/>
     The present design only supports 1 transfer per access. An access is a host's request for a read or a write to the SDRAM. A transfer is any data size from 1 byte, 1 word (16bit) or 1 long-word (32 bit). As soon as a multi-longword (i.e. burst) data transfer protocol for the OR1K is adopted, variants of the SDRAM controller supporting it will be offered.
     <br/>
     The core also includes a set of synthesiable "test" modules. When enabled for compilation, these test modules becomes a host to the SDRAM controller and issues a series of read/write test sequences to the SDRAM. This allows designers working on FPGA/CPLD platforms to turn the SDRAM controller core into a "stand-alone" SDRAM tester.
     <br/>
     The core has been sucessfully tested with a Samsung KM416S1120D SDRAM on Altera Flex10K20 FPGA and :Lattice isp3256 CPLD devices (using the built-in tester).
