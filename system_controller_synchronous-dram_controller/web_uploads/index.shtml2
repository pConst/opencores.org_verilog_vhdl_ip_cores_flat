                  <P>The Synchronous-DRAM controller core allows any asynchronous
                  bus masters, such as most Intel microcontroller and x86 processors,
                  to effortlessly interface to a large capacity SDRAM. By default
                  the core is configured to work with 2-bank x 512-Word x 16-bit
                  SDRAMs such as NEC uPD451616A, Samsung KM416S1120D, OKIMSM56V16160D.
                  Easy modifications allows the core to work with different capacity
                  SDRAMs. Most of the critical parameters are defines in a global
                  include file allowing easy reconfigurability of the core.</P>

                  <P>The core handles much of the low level functions such as address
                  demultiplexing, refresh generation and busy status generation.
                  In addtion, the non-trivial powerup initialization sequence is
                  also handled transparently to the host. Flexible refresh generation
                  permits burst refresh, normal refresh or everything in between.
                  The SDRAM mode-register can also be reprogrammed on the fly by
                  the host, although the core uses a default value upon powerup.</P>

                  <P>The core also includes a set of synthesiable &quot;test&quot;
                  modules. When enabled for compilation, these test modules becomes
                  a host to the SDRAM controller and issues a series of read/write
                  test sequences to the SDRAM. This allows designers working on
                  FPGA/CPLD platforms to turn the SDRAM controller core into a
                  &quot;stand-alone&quot; SDRAM tester. </P>

                  <P>The core has been sucessfully tested with a Samsung KM416S1120D
                  SDRAM on Altera Flex10K20 FPGA and :Lattice isp3256 CPLD devices
                  (using the built-in tester).</P>
