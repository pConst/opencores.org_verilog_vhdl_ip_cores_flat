This is 8-bit microprocessor with 5 instructions. This architecture called SAP for Simple-As-Possible computer. It very useful design which introduces most of the basic and fundamental ideas behind computer operation.
This design could be used for instruction classes for undergraduate classes or specific VHDL classes. This processor is based on the 8080 architecture, therefore, it could be upgraded step by step to integrate further facilities. It is very exciting challenge for the students to do so. Further, they could think about building complete system, i.e. integrating and I/O peripherals to the processor.
The design is proven for ASIC and FPGA. It was implemented using Xilinx FPGA Spartan-3E starter kit. A full documentation for the code and the used resources are attached within the project.
I hope that you will enjoy it.
Personally, I recommend you to start building your own design then you can compare to this one as a reference design. We learn from our mistakes.
I will be glad to receive your feedback and comments, acknowledgments would be great as well.

# How to start? #
##############
To run the attached script, the user needs (for Linux users):
ghdl http://ghdl.free.fr/
gtkwave http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/
firefox 
Acrobat Reader

After unzipping the zipped file
	unzip sap.zip
	tar xvf sap.tar.gz
change to the unzipped folder
	cd sap
Go through the help files to have a quick overview (start with the HTML)
	acroread ./help/pdf/refman.pdf
	firefox ./help/html/index.html
Execute the TCL script and check the output waveforms on the GTKwave window
	source ghdl.tcl

The user can all the signals into the trace window. All of signals appears there, you have to start reading the help to understand the signals. However, the stored program in the ROM can be found in the help of the ROM module.
