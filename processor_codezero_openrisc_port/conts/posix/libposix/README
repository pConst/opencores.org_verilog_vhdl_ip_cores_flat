Copyright (C) 2007 Bahadir Balban

Despite the name, this is a library that supports only a small portion of posix
functions.

Note however, that unlike many other shallow POSIX implementations function
listed below are backed by a real virtual memory subsystem and a virtual
filesystem.

Highest priority POSIX functions are:

shmat
shmget
shmdt
mmap
munmap
sbrk
read
readdir
write
lseek
open
close
creat
mkdir
mknod
link
unlink
fork
clone
execve
getpid
wait
kill
getenv
setenv


Currently supported functions are:

shmat
shmget
shmdt
mmap
munmap
read
readdir
write
lseek
open
close
creat
mkdir
mknod
fork
clone
execve
exit
getpid


Functions to be supported in the near future are:

link
unlink
wait
kill
sbrk
getenv
setenv


Other calls:
pipe
mount
unmount
swapon


New ones will be added as needed.
