Missing tests:

1) Library tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- L4Lib Thread library needs to be tested
  - Stack allocation
  - UTCB allocation
- L4Lib Capability library needs to be tested
  - Capability read, print, manipulation

- Address allocation, id allocation functions need to be tested.

- Page allocator needs to be tested.
- Memcache needs to be tested.
- All above libraries must be tested with many many different combinations.


2) API Tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Null pointer tests
- Extended IPC via page faulting.
- Mutex tests on different virtual but same physical page.
- Cache flushing tests
- Capability limit tests (e.g. pushing limits of given capabilities)
- Capability manipulation tests (manipulating existing capabilities)

3) Performance Tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Performance tests should fall back to using timer if perfmon does not exist.
Performance tests need to run on multiple architectures.
(e.g. beagleboard perfmon, timer ...)
- Map/unmap
- Ipc results are missing
