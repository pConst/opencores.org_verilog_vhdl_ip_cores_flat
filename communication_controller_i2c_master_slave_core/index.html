     Description

    <p id="p_Description">
     Since lots of people ask me questions about my core, i want to clarify some things:
     <br/>
     1) the master works, the slave is not entirely thought-through, i used it in simulation only.
     <br/>
     2) i'm adding a diagram, that explains how to control the core.
     <br/>
     3) adding a file name i2c_master_v01.vhd, that containes the master only.
     <br/>
     4) since i have some time now, i will try to work on the slave.
     <br/>
     have fun!
     <br/>
     Eli.
     <br/>
     The file name is V02 because V01 contained only an unwilling to work master.
     <br/>
     it will not be posted here.
     <br/>
     Master:
     <br/>
     *supports burst writes and reads
     <br/>
     *fully controlled by interface
     <br/>
     for now i build a different interface for each use of the core.
     <br/>
     in he future i plan to build a generic controller, that will act as a bridge from the PCI PLB to I2c.
