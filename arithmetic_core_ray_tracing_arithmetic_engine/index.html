    <p id="p_Description">
     Ray Tracing : A rendering technique that challenges anyone who is interested in Computer Science, Computer Graphics and Digital Systems in General.
     <br/>
     The Main Goal of this project is to create an engine to Render 3D models. This engine is made over HW/SW. What Im planning to do is to make a RTL generic enough to plug it along with a processor, by means of a bus or any connector the developer wishes.
     <br/>
     So the RTL's published on this page will describe the HW part of the engine. I don't know, YET, if I'm allowed to upload SW source code.  If I am, for sure I will, but if not a proper project page will be set on the next days. I will publish, as mentioned, the soruce code for a NIOS II processor, and that will be the Rendering Engine SW portion.
     <br/>
     So, what I expect is to achieve a simple HW portion of the Rendering Engine, that serves on its original purpose -a  Ray Tracing Rendering Engine- but in the near future, I would hope to see the engine to be used for General Purposes.
     <br/>
     Anyway It will be my mayor achievment if some day these RTL's are taken as examples in order to learn VHDL and Hardware description and Hardware Design.
