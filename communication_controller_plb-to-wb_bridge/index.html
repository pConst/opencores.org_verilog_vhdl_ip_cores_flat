     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     The intention of the project is the development of a bus bridge, which enables the usage of WB compliant IP cores in a system, which uses the Processor Local Bus (PLB) as system and peripheral bus. The PLB-to-WB (PLB2WB) Bridge enables the access to slaves on the WB side for masters on the PLB side.

     <br/>
     Features:
     <br/>
     - separate clock domains for PLB and WB
     <br/>
     - separate resets for PLB and WB possible
 - PLB address pipelining (optional)
     <br/>
     - PLB fixed length burst transfers (only words, optional)
     <br/>
     - PLB line transfers (optional)
     <br/>
     - WB B.3 classic cycles (block and single, block cyckes are optional)
     <br/>
     - flexible address offset
     <br/>
     - handling of delayed write errors on WB side
 - transfers interrupts to PLB side

     File and Folder Structure
    </h2>
    <p id="p_File and Folder Structure">
     You can checkout all files with the following command:
    </p>
    <p class="u_cmd">
     svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/plb2wbbridge/plb2wbbridge/trunk/
    </p>
    <br/>
    Because this bridge was intended to be used with Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS), the file and folder structure is a little bit different to other OpenCores projects. But if you are going to use XPS, just add
    <p class="u_cmd">
     systems/EDK_Libs
    </p>
    to your module search path.
    <br/>
    If you are not going to use XPS, you can find all VHDL source files in
    <p class="u_cmd">
     systems/EDK_Libs/WishboneIPLib/pcores/plb2wb_bridge_v1_00_a/hdl/vhdl/
    </p>
    <br/>
    Some simulation systems for testing the functionality are located in
    <p class="u_cmd">
     systems/test_system_sim/
    </p>
    and
    <p class="u_cmd">
     systems/dev_system_sim/
    </p>
    contains a simulation system to implement new features.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you are using a Xilinx toolchain with Xilinx FPGAs, the folder
    <p class="u_cmd">
     coregen/fifo_generator/
    </p>
    contains a Ruby script and a configuration file to auto-generate all necessary FIFOs (see documentation for more information).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Last but not least, you will find the documentation in
    <p class="u_cmd">
     doc/

     PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROJECT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE 2010. THE PLB BUS IS NOT USED ANYMORE IN CURRENT XILINX SOCS AND THERE IS NO MORE NEED FOR THIS PROJECT.
     <br/>
     This project was started as a student work at HS-Pforzheim University (Germany).
     <br/>
     The project was finished in the middle of august 2010.
     <br/>
     The PLB-to-WB Bridge is implemented and all functionality is tested via RTL simulation.
     <br/>
     In addition, basic functionality is tested in a SoC for a Virtex-5 FPGA.
     <br/>
     Because there is never an end, the following list shows some open issues
     <br/>
     - Implementation of WB B.4 interface
     <br/>
     - Implementation of WB registered feedback bus cycles
