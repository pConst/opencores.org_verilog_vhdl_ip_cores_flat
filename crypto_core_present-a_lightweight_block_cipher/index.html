     Present is a lightweight block cipher dedicated to implement in Hardware. It was developed by Knudsen team.
    </p>
    <p>
     This cipher operates on the 64 bit text with use of 80 bit key. It uses S/P blocks and xor operations for encryption and key update through 32 rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this project I created:
     <br/>
     - Present module dedicated to 32 bit Hardware (32 bit I/O and working under state machine)
     <br/>
     &#160;&#160; This is much for 'archive' state due to it was part of my students project, and it is not a 'pure' implementation of PRESENT.
- "Pure" Present implementation "as is" in the Knudsen article
     <br/>
     - Present cipher Decoder
     <br/>
     - Some helpful programs written in Java used for testing VHDL modules
     <br/>
     - Some modules used for testing communication with PC
     <br/>
     - Full documentation for each subproject
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     These modules were tested on Digilent Spartan 3E Starter Boart (Spartan XC3S500E) - except 32 bit I/O version
