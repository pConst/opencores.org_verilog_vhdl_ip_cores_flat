    <p id="p_Description">
     This Floating Point units were developed as part of the HAVOC project. The Design schematics and related files can be browsed at the FPU repository, or downloaded as a separate file from the FP units home page.
     <br/>
     The FP Adder is a single-precision, IEEE-754 compilant, signed adder/substractor. It includes both single-cycle and 6-stage pipelined designs. The design is fully synthesizable and has been tested in a Xilinx Virtex-II XC2V3000 FPGA, occupying 385 CLBs and with a theoretical maximum operating frecuency of 6MHz for the single-cycle  design and 87MHz for the pipelined design. The design was tested at 33MHz.
     <br/>
     The FP Multiplier is a single-precision, IEEE-754 compilant, signed multiplier. It includes both single-cycle and 4-stage pipelined designs. The design is fully synthesizable and has been tested in a Xilinx Virtex-II XC2V3000 FPGA, occupying 119 CLBs and with a theoretical maximum operating frecuency of 8MHz for the single-cycle  design and 90MHz for the pipelined design. The design was tested at 33MHz.

     - Initial Release made available in June, 2004. Uploaded in November 2004.
     <br/>
     - Updated in July 2006. Removed references to the HAVOC library, now using the default work. Corrected bug handling the underflow in the multiplier (thanks to H. Sakman for reporting the bug).
     <br/>
     - Updated in June 2010. Fixed a bug in the normalization when the add of two normal numbers produced a denormal, they where not properly represented. Many thanks to Math Verstraelen for reporting this bug.
