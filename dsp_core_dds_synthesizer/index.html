    <p id="p_Description">
     The DDS IP core (dds_synthesizer) is a implementation of a direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDS) (also called number controlled oscillator, NCO) which produces a sinewave at the output with a specified frequency and phase (adjustable at runtime).

Only one quater of the sinewave is stored in the LUT, the rest is computed by simple operations (negating, subtraction), resulting in a reduced memory requirement.

The resolution of the frequency tuning word (FTW), the phase and the amplitude defined seperately. Several precomputed look-up tables are provided as combinations from 8 to 16 bit phase and amplitude resolution. The frequency resolution can is defined as generic. A matlab script for generating the LUTs for different resolutions is included.

The design is fully pipelined for maximum throughput.
