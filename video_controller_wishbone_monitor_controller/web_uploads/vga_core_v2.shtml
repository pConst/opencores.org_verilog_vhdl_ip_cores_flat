<h1>Wishbone Monitor Controller Accelerated VGA Core</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<strong>Wishbone Monitor Controller Accelerated VGA Core</strong> adds a 
acceleration and palette support to the <a href="vga_core.shtml">
VGA core</a> module. All it's interfaces are WishboneTK compatible
and thus can be used to integrate with into a SoC design. It has no
directly mapped pixel memory seen from the CPU side. It is intended as
a DEMO application rather than a real-world example.
