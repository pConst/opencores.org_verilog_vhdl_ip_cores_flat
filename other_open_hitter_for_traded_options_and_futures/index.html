    <p id="p_Description">
     This project will have a slow start .. I won't be able to support new joiners until at least 2016.
     <br/>
     However, advice and experience is welcome, especially if there are LGPL/BSD projects I missed or that can be reused (eg the 'esoc')
     <br/>
     Expectation
     <br/>
     The open_hitter will be accessible to fpga newbies yet offer a realistic high frequency trading system, in open source.  In delivery terms, an HFT techie might buy an ebay ML605 demo board and use an old Mac to demonstrate an out-of-the box working and extendable prototype at their workplace, and so bring more firms into this technology.
     <br/>
     Expectation (2)
     <br/>
     I further expect that the heart of the system will be quite straightforward and implemented in not-very-much vhdl.  The challenge is around making the system manageable and monitorable (buildable) without costly licenses or training, to bring more developers into this technology.
     <br/>
     Ownership
     <br/>
     Rather than publish a 100% project I'm starting small and online.  This way there will be a record of the IP added and clearly open ownership.  The same applies to the implementation design which must evolve through the project process.
     <br/>
     Build Design
     <br/>
     I'll use ghdl to develop modules and verify to fpga at least every two weeks.
     <br/>
     The implementation should include a control and reporting array managed via wishbone and some open cpu running linux [on Xilinx Virtex 6 ML605]
     <br/>
     Build Steps
     <br/>
     1. Expand core test harness to include a notional exchange sending prices and accepting response orders, a control protocol and design detail.
     <br/>
     2. Implement a parallel search across nodes, converting exchange prices into response orders (or not).
     <br/>
     3. Control / reporting array and wishbone connection
     <br/>
     4. Select open soft cpu and work on the build.
