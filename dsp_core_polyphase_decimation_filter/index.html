     This is a behavioral SystemC model for Polyphase Decimation filters. It can be used as for system design and functional verification. It has been tested with Matlab and Octave as well. If you need any further illustrations or further modifications, don't hesitate to contact me. It can be used effectively for class instruction. It is a good practice for SystemC beginners and DSP student/engineers as well.
