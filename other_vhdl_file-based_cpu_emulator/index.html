    <p id="p_Description of project">
     This project emulates a CPU for an FPGA under simulation with the use of text files. It can be used to test an FPGA - CPU interface using realistic real-world stimuli. One main text file per CPU emulation instance is used for global CPU commands, and thread spawning. Each spawned thread is tied to an additional text file to use as its 'source code'.

    <p id="p_Functionality:">
     Features:
     <br/>
     Configuration of clock, and reset, and read latency.
     <br/>
     Wait for time period
     <br/>
     Wait for signal value (good for interrupts)
     <br/>
     Declare local and global variables (bit, vector8, or string)
     <br/>
     Nested while loops with separate variable space in each nesting
     <br/>
     Nested if conditionals (no new variable space)
     <br/>
     Unlimited number of threads
     <br/>
     Print variables to a file (line by line)
     <br/>
     Write a value or variable to an address
     <br/>
     Read a value from an address and place in variable
     <br/>
     Read using a DMA and writing values to a file
     <br/>
     Thread control:
     <br/>
     Each thread runs until it hits a wait or the end of the file. If no wait is hit, then it will continue to run and choke the system. There is no DMA write provided as the software supports only 0 latency writes such that consecutive writes in a while loop perform the DMA. See ctc.txt lines 24 - 36 for an example of this. All commands other than wait, read and write take 0 time. Only wait or wait_interruptX cause the thread switching.
     <br/>
     Usage:
     <br/>
     The provided design_top_tb.vhd uses the cpu_sim.vhd, package.vhd, and the accompanying text files to show some accesses. the file access_2us.txt shows a simple read occuring every 2 microseconds. The other text files are some examples of real world use, but they won't work as they are. They need to be modified for your design needs.
