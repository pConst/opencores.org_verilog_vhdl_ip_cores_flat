    <p id="p_Description">
     The serial_divide_uu is a Verilog coded module that performs binary division.  It is fully parameterized, and works in a serial fashion.  The number of clock cycles required to complete a divide operation is equal to the number of bits in the quotient plus one.
     <br/>
     This module has been tested and debugged in actual hardware on a Xilinx XC2S200E FPGA.  It was used to divide pulse width by period in a pulse-width-modulation measurement application (ADXL202E 2-axis MEMS accelerometers.)
     <br/>
     The widths of the signals are configurable by parameters, as follows:
     <br/>
     M_PP = Bit width of the dividend
     <br/>
     N_PP = Bit width of the divisor
     <br/>
     R_PP = Remainder bits desired
     <br/>
     S_PP = Skipped quotient bits
     <br/>
     The skipped quotient bits parameter provides a way to prevent the divider from calculating the full M_PP+R_PP output bits, in case some of the leading bits are already known to be zero.  This is the case, for example, when dividing two quantities to obtain a result that is a fraction between 0 and 1 (as when measuring PWM signals).  In that case the integer portion of the quotient is always zero, and therefore it need not be calculated.
     <br/>
     For those who have the luxury of many clock cycles to use up, this module can provide division results of arbitrary precision.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - Fully parameterized Verilog code, tested and debugged
     <br/>
     - No testbench
     <br/>
     - Calculates roughly one bit of output per clock cycle.
     <br/>
     - Parameter "HELD_OUTPUT_PP" allows user to trade off extra flip-flops for the ability to hold the stable output of the previous divide, during the next divide operation.
     <br/>
     - Useful for DSP systems.

     - Try it out, this module works.
     <br/>
     - Code is very well commented, with a description of operation in the header, which suffices for documentation.
     <br/>
     - Thanks to David Sala for writing and submitting a VHDL testbench and VHDL version of this code.

     David Sala has gracious translated this module into VHDL code, and provided a testbench for it.  This should improve this project and make it accessible and useful to more people.  Thanks David!
