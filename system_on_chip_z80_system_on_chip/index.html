     <br/>
     This project is a SOC designed for Altera DE1 development board and the Diligent Spartan 3E, and provide access to leds, switches, buttons, IO pins, SRAM, VGA, LCD and keyboard using Z80 assembly language.
     <br/>
     Comes with a reference ROM application that show how to access all resources on the board. Spartan 3E port provides easy access to the LCD (memory mapped, 32 bytes of ram).
     <br/>
     There are tools included in the project files to convert fonts (psf) to MIF and COE, and convert files containing hex codes in VHDL ROM files, what makes it very easy to generate new roms for the system (requires cygwin on windows or linux/unix shell).
