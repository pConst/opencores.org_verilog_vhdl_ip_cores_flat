    <p id="p_Description">
     This project uses two off the shelf boards and interfaces them. The processor board used is a Olimex LPC-L2294 and the FPGA board is a Terasic DE1. A Olimex ARM-USB-OCD was used to load and debug the code. The boards were cabled together with floppy and hard drive cables. The entire setup cost less than $350.
     <br/>
     The bridge from the wb_async_mem_bridge project is used to interface the External Memory Controller to the Wishbone bus on the FPGA. Currently the SRAM, GPIOs &amp; HEX LED display is connected and there are plans to add the other interfaces on the DE1 as time permits.
     <br/>
     Ecos has been ported and there are some simple examples of multithreading and interrupts. The shell interface was borrowed from redboot has been striped down and adapted to run in it's own thread.
