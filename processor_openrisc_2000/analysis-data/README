This directory contains data files used in the analysis of the existing
instruction set. In each case they are a single file, tarred and bzipped for
compactness.

  linux.s.tar.bz2.   The Linux kernel
  or1ksim.s.tar.bz2. All the Or1ksim tests

Various analyses have been carried out. Some of these make use of awk scripts,
which may be found in this directory.

An OpenOffice calc analysis of the data is provided here.

For details of the analysis see the Website and Wiki.
