Notes
-----

1. The configuration bitstring for the FPGA is stored in the
   topmost quadrant of the Flash ROM (which is quadrant 3, with
   starting address 0x180000). The DIP switch setting required
   to access this quadrant during autoload on power-up is thus
   SW1-1 = OFF, SW1-2 = OFF.

2. The machine monitor is also stored in the Flash ROM, starting
   at address 0x000000. The ECO32 CPU can access the machine
   monitor at virtual address 0xE0000000. The monitor's size
   must not exceed 24 * 64 KB (3 quadrants of the Flash ROM).

3. Here is the command which burns the monitor as well as the
   configuration bitstring into the Flash ROM:
      ~/fpgalab-0.3/build/bin/xsload \
         -usb \
         -fwrite ../../monitor/xsa-xst-3/monitor.exo ./eco32.exo \
         -autoload
