1. Installing JTAG cable drivers under Ubuntu:
   a) When installing ISE, do NOT install any cable drivers.
   b) sudo apt-get install \
        gitk git-gui libusb-dev build-essential libc6-dev fxload
   c) git clone git://git.zerfleddert.de/usb-driver
   d) cd usb-driver
   e) make
   f) ./setup_pcusb /opt/Xilinx/14.5/ISE_DS/ISE/

2. The configuration bitstring for the FPGA is stored in the
   "Platform Flash PROM" (XCF04S). The board must therefore be
   jumpered for "Master Serial Mode" (all 3 jumpers installed).

3. Here is the command which burns the configuration bitstring
   into the Platform Flash PROM:
      /opt/Xilinx/14.5/ISE_DS/ISE/bin/lin/impact -batch ./program.cmd

4. The machine monitor is stored in the "StrataFlash Parallel NOR
   Flash PROM" (28F128J3), starting at address 0x000000. The ECO32
   CPU can access the machine monitor at virtual address 0xE0000000.
   The monitor's size must not exceed 16 MB (the size of the Flash PROM).

5. In order to program the machine monitor into the Flash PROM, proceed
   as follows (briefly, the FPGA is used as a Flash PROM programmer):
   a) Connect a serial cable to the starter board. This is needed in
      order to communicate with the Flash programmer. Use connector J9
      (the DCE connector) and a straight-through cable.
   b) Transfer the MCS file you wish to program into the Flash PROM
      (in our case the monitor, ../../monitor/s3e-500/monitor.mcs)
      to the computer to which the serial cable is connected.
   c) Start a serial communication program (e.g. minicom) on the
      computer connected to the serial cable. The communication
      parameters must be set as follows:
         - choose the serial port to which the cable is connected
           (this is /dev/tty00 on my computer)
         - 115200 baud
         - 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit ("8N1")
         - software flow control ("XON/XOFF protocol")
         - line wrap on (otherwise you won't see all chars of long lines)
         - add linefeed on (the programmer sends CR, but not LF)
         - local echo off (the programmer does echo itself)
   d) Here is the command that loads the FPGA with the programmer:
         /opt/Xilinx/14.5/ISE_DS/ISE/bin/lin/impact -batch ./flash-500.cmd
      If the download succeeds, you should see the message "PicoBlaze NOR
      FLASH Programmer v1.00" on the computer which is connected via the
      serial line to the starter board, as well as a menue of commands
      (E, B, P, W, R, I, H, S), and a prompt (">"). Try the commands 'h'
      (the menue should be sent again), 'i' (the device ID 89 18 should
      be displayed), and 's' (the status should be 80).
   e) Erase the flash ROM completely by pressing 'e'. This command must
      be confirmed with an upper case 'Y' and can run for a few minutes.
      The command sends the character '.' repeatedly to show its progress.
   f) Program the ROM with the command 'p'. You will have to specify the
      name of the MCS file to your communication program somehow (with
      minicom, it's "CTRL-A Z Y <choose file> <okay>"). Your communication
      program should send the contents of the file as if it has been
      typed at the keyboard, without changing any character.
   g) Verify what you have programmed with the command 'r', followed by
      exactly 6 hex digits which represent the starting address of 256
      bytes (these bytes will be dumped to your screen).

6. The two programming tasks (FPGA bistring into Platform Flash PROM
   and monitor into Parallel NOR Flash PROM) may be carried out in
   any sequence.
