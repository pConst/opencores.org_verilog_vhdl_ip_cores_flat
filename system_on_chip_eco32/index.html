     Description

    <p id="p_Description">
     The ECO32 system is a microprocessor system-on-chip, consisting of
     <br/>
     a 32-bit CPU and several controllers for peripheral devices (keyboard,
     <br/>
     character display, timer, serial line, SDRAM, Flash-ROM, IDE disk).
     <br/>
     The ECO32 CPU is a simple 32-bit RISC processor with an instruction
     <br/>
     set loosely modelled after MIPS, currently without floating point
     <br/>
     instructions. We want to execute some flavour of UNIX on it, so it
     <br/>
     has got two operating modes (kernel/user) and a memory management
     <br/>
     unit (paging with TLB support). The processor was first simulated
     <br/>
     at the instruction set level (the simulator is included), then at
     <br/>
     the HDL level, and has finally been implemented in an FPGA.
     <br/>
     Included in the project is an ANSI C compiler (LCC from Fraser and
     <br/>
     Hanson) with a back-end for ECO32, a simple tool chain (assembler
     <br/>
     and linker), as well as a monitor program, which can be flashed into
     <br/>
     non-volatile memory on an FPGA board. Also included are tools to
     <br/>
     create a disk image which can be used as the system disk with the
     <br/>
     simulator. A disk server makes this "disk" available for the real
     <br/>
     ECO32 on an FPGA over a serial line. An IDE (parallel ATA) disk or
     <br/>
     an SSD can be accessed from the real ECO32 as well.
