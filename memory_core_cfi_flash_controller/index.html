    <p id="p_Description">
     CFI flash controller IP.
     <br/>
     Provides two modes of operation - simple (Wishbone bus straight through to flash bus, essentially, but with 32-bit word read capability, allowing XIP - execute in place - for 32-bit processors) and a "CFI engine" mode, which aims to simplify interfacing with a CFI flash.
     <br/>
     Only implements asynchronous flash bus interface.
     <br/>
     System bus interface is Wishbone, or CFI engine module can be used stand-alone and provides a generic bus interface.
     <br/>
     Both modes tested with Intel P30 Strataflash part on Xilinx ML501 board.
     <br/>
     Is implemented in the ORPSoC ml501 board port. A software driver for, and programming utility using this core can also be found in ORPSoC. XIP has been tested and works for OR1200 processor in ORPSoC.
     <br/>
     Simple mode has been found to work fine with Strataflash drivers found in u-boot and Linux.
     <br/>
     See the README under the doc/ path for further information.
