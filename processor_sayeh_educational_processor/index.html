     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     The SAYEH processor (Simple Architecture,Yet Enough Hardware) has been designed for educational and benchmarking purpose. Relying on the material of the computer architecture course provide the necessary background for understanding details of the hardware of SAYEH, so it could be useful IP core for graduate or last year undergraduate students to implement computer architecture materials in a real processor design.
     <br/>
     Originally SAYEH has been developed in ECE at university of Tehran, IRAN.
