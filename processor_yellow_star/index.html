    <p id="p_Description">
     It is capable of executing 32bit instructions based on the MIPS R3000 microprocessor instruction set and has been tested running large blocks of compiled C code.
     <br/>
     Fully functional and compatible interrupt system. Can handle all exceptions cleanly and correctly.
     <br/>
     Two 2Kbyte (Data and Instruction) direct mapped caches with coherency.
     <br/>
     Memory management unit with 64 Entry TLB fully compatible to original design.
     <br/>
     Designed in Powerview package but can be distributed in hierarchical schematic EDIF
     <br/>
     Warning: The manual stated instructions SWL, SWR, LWL and LWR which are not implemented. And there are known bugs in the code.
     <br/>

     <br/>
     The processor was created using schematics and there is NO RTL VHDL or Verilog.
