    <p id="p_Description">
     Configurable cpu core that supports Z80, 8080 and gameboy instruction sets.

Z80 and 8080 compability have been proven by numerous implementations of old computer and arcade systems.
It is used in the
     
      zxgate
     
     project, a zx81, zx spectrum, trs80 and Jupiter ACE clone project.
And also in the
     
      FPGA Arcade
     
     project.

A Z80 SoC debug system with ROM, RAM and two 16450 UARTs is included in the distribution. It is possible to run the NoICE debugger on this system.

Batch files for runnning XST and Leonardo synthesis can be found in
     
      syn/xilinx/run/
     
     . Check these scripts to see how to use the included VHDL ROM generators.

Before you can run the scripts you need to compile hex2rom and xrom or download binaries from
     
      here
     
     . You must also replace one of the hex files in sw/ or change the batch files to use another hex file.

The
     
      z88dk
     
     C compiler can be used with T80. The "embedded" configuration can be used with the debug system without modifications.

Thanks to MikeJ for some serious debugging and to the zxgate project members for invaluable Z80 information.
