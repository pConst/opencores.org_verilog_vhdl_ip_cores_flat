     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     This project implements an 8 bit controller that is compatible with Atmel's AVR architecture, using VHDL (Very High speed integrated circuits Hardware Description Language).
     <br/>
     pAVR is not a specific controller of the AVR family, but rather a maximally featured AVR. It is configurable enough to be able to simulate most AVR family controllers.
     <br/>
     The goal was to obtain an AVR processor that is as powerful as possible (in terms of MIPS), with a work budget of about 6 months*man.
     <br/>
     pAVR is about 3x faster than the original core, if built with the same technology.
     <br/>
     The sources are modularized. They are written starting from a set of common-sense conventions (the process splitting strategy, signals naming, etc)., so that pAVR is quite an easily maintainable design. A comprehensive documentation is provided.
     <br/>
     Extensive testing was carried out.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - 6 pipeline stages
     <br/>
     - 1 clock/instruction for most instructions
     <br/>
     - estimated clock frequency: ~50 MHz &amp; 0.5 um; assuming that Atmel's core runs at 15 MHz &amp; 0.5 um. That's ~3x Atmel original core's performance.
     <br/>
     - estimated MIPS at 50 MHz: 28 MIPS (typical), 50 MIPS (peak). That's ~3x Atmel original core's performance. At 15 MHz, Atmel's core has 10 MIPS typical, and 15 MIPS peak.
     <br/>
     - CPI (clocks per instruction): 1.7 clocks/instruction (typical), 1 clock/instruction (peak). That's ~0.75x (typical), 1.00x (peak) Atmel original core's performance.
     <br/>
     - up to 32 interrupt sources. Each interrupt has programmable priority and jump address.
     <br/>
     - heavily parameterized design that permits flexible costumization
     <br/>
     - pAVR architecture is rather computational-friendly than control-friendly. Jumps, branches, skips, calls and returns are relatively expansive in terms of clocks. A branch prediction scheme and a smarter return procedure might be considered as upgrades.

     Summer 2002: project done.
     <br/>
     November 2003: Stefan Kristiansson found a skips-related bug. It's fixed from version 0.33. Thanks Stefan!
     <br/>
     A new version is on its way. It's not fully tested tet. Hopefully I'll have time to upload it into an FPGA, and run some heavy weight programs, such as a C compiler.
     <br/>
     I am using Xilinx tools: the WebPack free synthesis software, and a Spartan 3 board from
     
      NU Horizons
     
     .
     <br/>
     If you synthesize pAVR and think it would be useful to share your experience with others, you're very welcome to post your results here, in the newly created
     
      synthesis page
     
     . Just email me at doru@opencores.org. You'll be helping pAVR getting more and more reliable. Thanks.
     <br/>
     Autumn 2005: bugs discovered. Changed status from "Stable" to "Alpha". Don't know when I'll have time to debug it :(

     Note: pAVR's CVS repository is not updated - it contains the ancient version 0.32. I don't plan to use CVS much. Thus, take care to get the latest version from the downloads page, not from CVS repository.
