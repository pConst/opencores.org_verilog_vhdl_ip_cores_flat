    <p id="p_Description">
     Opensource OpenRisc Development Board. All CADsoft Eagle design files available to recreate the board using EagleLite, a freeware PCB design tool. Uses the largest Cyclone 2 device available in a QFP package, thus allowing larger RTL designs to be ported, and at the same time allowing easier PCB design and board assembly. Board design is double sided, and can be manufactured using low cost batch PCB services. But despite only being double layer, it has an almost continuous bottom side ground plane.
A complete system consists of two separate boards;
- Main FPGA board that contains the FPGA, SDRAM, regulators, Santa Cruz expansion header, and Support board expansion header. 
- Support board containing SD card slot, SPI flash, C8051, fpgaConfig header, JTAG header, OpenRisc debug header and RS-232 DB9 connector.
A complete FPGA project is available for the board set. This includes a minimal

     , and
     
      <b>
       SD memory interface
      </b>
     
     . Simulation is possible using Icarus Verilog simulator, and the design can be compiled under Altera Quartus.
Software is available to demonstrate copying a software image file from SD flash memory to SDRAM, and then executing the copied image.
See

     project for details of configuring FPGA from SD flash memory:

You can use this project as a basis for a compact OpenRisc implementation. A complete OpenRisc implementation requires just an FPGA, SDRAM, microSD card, and a tiny C8051.

Contents:

- FPGA Main Board
- FPGA Support Board
- USB2Flash programming adapter and USB cable
- Connecting ribbon cables
- Wall wart 5V power supply
- RS-232 cable
- CD-ROM 

Everything is included to allow you to start running right out of the box. And it's all open source! The CD-ROM includes several tools such as Icarus Verilog, GTKwave, Cygwin, OpenRISC tool chain, and of course example projects which you can compile into hardware using Altera Quartus, or simulate using the Icarus simulator.
