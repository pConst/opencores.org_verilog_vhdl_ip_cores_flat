    <p id="p_Description">
     This is another UART project, but is different because that it is very small and will occupy less macrocells on a CPLD.
     <br/>
     The purpose of this core is only to implement a very basic UART, without handshaking or FIFO's.
     <br/>
     It was developed to be syntezizable on a large number of syntesis tools, so it can be adapted to your device easily.
     <br/>
     On the first implementation was used a Xilinx Spartan 3E, with 64 occupied slices.
     <br/>
     Please read the documentation, it have useful implementation examples.
     <br/>
     For the testing was used the Modelsim simulator and a Enterpoint Drigmorn board, connected with some hardware, as described on the documentation.
     <br/>
     If this core was useful I will be very pleased if you send me some information of your project.
     <br/>
     For bugs send me an email, as soon as possible the corrections will be done.

     Can work on a small CPLD.
     <br/>
     Works with CPU's using interruptions.
     <br/>
     Can be even smaller changing constants and generics
