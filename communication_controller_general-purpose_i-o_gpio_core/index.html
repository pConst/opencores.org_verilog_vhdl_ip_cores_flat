     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     The GPIO IP core is user-programmable general-purpose I/O controller. Its use is to implement functions that are not implemented with the dedicated controllers in a system and require simple input and/or output software controlled signals.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     The following lists the main features of GPIO IP core: 

- Number of general-purpose I/O signals is user selectable and can be in range from 1 to 32. For more I/Os several GPIO cores can be used in parallel. 
- All general-purpose I/O signals can be bi-directional (external bi-directional I/O cells are required in this case). 
- All general-purpose I/O signals can be three-stated or open-drain enabled (external three-state or open-drain I/O cells are required in this case). 
- General-purpose I/O signals programmed as inputs can cause interrupt to the CPU. 
- General-purpose I/O signals programmed as inputs can be registered at raising edge of system clock or at user programmed edge of external clock. 
- All general-purpose I/O signals are programmed as inputs at hardware reset. 
- Auxiliary inputs to GPIO core to bypass outputs from RGPIO_OUT register. 
- Alternative input reference clock signal from external interface. 
- WISHBONE SoC Interconnection Rev. B compliant interface
