    <p id="p_Description">
     uart16550 is a 16550 compatible (mostly) UART core.
     <br/>
     The bus interface is WISHBONE SoC bus Rev. B.
     <br/>
     Features all the standard options of the 16550 UART: FIFO based operation, interrupt requests and other.
     <br/>
     The datasheet can be downloaded from the CVS tree along with the source code.

      <li>
       Aug 2001
       <br/>
       Core updated and some more bugs fixed. It is now being verified more thoroughly but it is mostly usable.
      </li>
      <li>
       27.05.2001
       <br/>
       Documentation and core code are updated.
      </li>
      <li>
       17.05.2001
       <br/>
       The core is finished unless more bugs are found.
       <br/>
       The test bench is very basic yet and is asking for your help to expand it. :-)
      </li>
      <li>

       <br/>
       The core is functional in polling mode, checked on FPGA.
       <br/>
       Should be functional in interrupts mode too but not verified fully in hardware.
       <br/>
       Monitor debugging feature is added
       <br/>
       All known bugs fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
       28.01.2002
       <br/>
       The core is functional in all modes (interrupt and polling mode), checked on two different boards.
       <br/>
       Full operational in uCLinux using included 16550 driver.
