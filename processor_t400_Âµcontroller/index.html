    <p>
     The T400 &#181;Controller is an implementation of National's 4-bit COP400 microcontroller family architecture. It is intended to be used as a replacement for the original chip in SOCs recreating legacy systems.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its final target is to provide design variants that are compatible with the COP420/421 and COP410L/411L family members. All of them derived from the common t400_core design. Such a sample system has been implemented in several FPGA families.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      COP421-like features
     </li>
     <li>
      64 bytes internal RAM
     </li>
     <li>
      1024 bytes internal ROM (only small part used for program)
     </li>
     <li>
      4 MHz required performance
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The implementation has been done with the free version of the vendor tools (Quartus II 7.2sp3 and ISE 10.1). Your mileage may vary.
