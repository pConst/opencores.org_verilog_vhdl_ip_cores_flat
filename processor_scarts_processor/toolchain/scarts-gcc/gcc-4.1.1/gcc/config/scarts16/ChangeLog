2010-02-19  Martin Walter <mwalter@opencores.org>

	* t-scarts16: migrated libgcc2 functions:
		div.c, divdi.c, fixfloat.c, moddi.c, muldi.c, udivdi.c, umoddi.c

2010-02-17  Martin Walter <mwalter@opencores.org>

	* scarts16.h: removed stabs debugging format
	* scarts16.h: added DWARF 2 debugging format
	* scarts16.c: implemented DWARF 2 debugging format

2009-07-16  Martin Walter <mwalter@opencores.org>

	* scarts16.h: added builtin definition "__SCARTS16__"
	* scarts16.h: prepended section names with ".section"
	* scarts16.h: changed ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME to produce more
		ELF-ish assembler code (added .global and .type)
	* scarts16.h: added ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE
	* scarts16.h: defined GLOBAL_ASM_OP; its absence rendered all
		symbols local in the object file
	* scarts16.h: changed .align to .p2align in ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN
		for the sake of clearness
	* scarts16.h: added "-lnosys" to LIB_SPEC; libnosys.a is newlib's
		syscall interface for SCARTS and needed by libc.a
	* scarts16.h: removed ENDFILE_SPEC, since all crtend0.o contained
		is now handled by linker scripts
	* scarts16.c: removed CPP-macros and C-style comments to produce
		assembly code that does not require CPP-ing
	* scarts16.c: replaced TARGET_ASM_INTEGER by proper definitions of
		TARGET_ASM_(BYTE|HI|SI|DI)_OP (both aligned and unaligned)
	* scarts16.c: fixed bug: integer comparisons against const char *
		scarts16_codesize and scarts16_datasize were relaced with
		their long integer interpretations
	* scarts16.c: changed feasible distance for branches from [-512; 511]
		to [-256; 511] since this is the maximum range that the GNU
		assembler can store in the 10-bit signed immediate of jmpi*
		instructions

2009-06-02  Martin Walter <mwalter@opencores.org>

	* config.gcc: added GNU as/ld and newlib specific options

	* scarts16.h: forked 16-bit version from 32-bit version

	* scarts16.c: same here

	* scarts16.md: same here

	that stack pointer is incremented/decremented and we are safe in

	* scarts.md: commented out modXX patterns, because the library
	functions are broken

	* scarts.c (scarts_unique_section): changed this function to avoid
	internal errors

2005-02-23  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	always in memory which is less efficient but on the safe side
	regarding bugs in the compiler

	* scarts.h (ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF): added this macro so a label
	called "data" cannot collide with the mnemonic of the same name

	layout

2005-02-19  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

2004-12-23  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	smoothly.

2004-03-15  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	* scarts.md ("xorxx3"): changed name from "eorxx3" to "xorxx3",
	because the first cause very bad code to be generated
	(shifts): simplified generation of move-patterns

2004-03-13  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	* scarts.c: fixed problems with the stack

2004-03-11  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	* scarts.md: added code and patterns so that shifts by constants
	are handled better

2004-03-10  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	* scarts.c (scarts_jump_mode): jumping offset was computed
	inversely, fixed this
	(asm_file_end): added guarding to the include of libgcc.s so it
	works always

2004-03-09  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	* scarts.c (scarts_out_branch): changed prefix for labels which are
	generated within insns, so that the convention now is the following:
	".<NUM>" for insn-generated labels, ".L<NUM>" for normal
	generated labels, ".<IDENT>_<NUM>" for labels from static
	variables

	* scarts.md: fixed allowable offsets for loading long and long long
	values
	Fixed a few typos that generated invalid memnonics.

	* scarts.h (BASE_REG_CLASS): after fiddling around to get away the
	"cannot find spill register" error, I changed this to
	GENERAL_REGS, and it seems to work, but further checking has to be
	done

2004-03-08  Wolfgang Puffitsch  <wolfgang@jeunesse.kamikaze>

	* scarts.md: added patterns for moving floating point values (only
	between already floating point items)

	* scarts.h: tweaked costs for moves, so that HFmode is handled now
	too

	* scarts.md: (subxx3) Simplified subxx3 patterns because there is
	no need for supporting constants due to canonicalisation.
	(general) Substituted "nonmemory_operand" with "register_operand"
	in some patterns that really support registers only.
