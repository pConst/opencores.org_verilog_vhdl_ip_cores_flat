--------------------
WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network N1 has no load.
WARNING:LIT:395 - The above warning message base_net_load_rule is repeated 8
   more times for the following (max. 5 shown):
   N2,
   DCM_LCD_CLK/CLKFX_OUT,
   DCM_LCD_CLK/N0,
   IMAGE/N136,

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:863 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargeted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFG symbol "DCM_LCD_CLK/CLK0_BUFG_INST" (output
   signal=DCM_LCD_CLK/CLK0_OUT),
   BUFG symbol "DCM_LCD_CLK/CLKDV_BUFG_INST" (output signal=CLK_LCD_OBUF),
   BUFG symbol "DCM_LCD_CLK/CLKFX_BUFG_INST" (output
   signal=DCM_LCD_CLK/CLKFX_OUT)
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal CLK_100M_PAD are pushed
   forward through input buffer.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the
   schematic.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  15 block(s) removed
  14 block(s) optimized away
  10 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
