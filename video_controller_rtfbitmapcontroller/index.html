    <p id="p_Description">
     This core is a low to medium resolution bitmap display controller. It was engineered for use on the
     <br/>
     Nexsys2 board, a Spartan3e FPGA board, but is readily adaptable to other environments. The core has
     <br/>
     been upgraded for use on the Atlys FPGA board. The latest incarnation of the core is being developed on a Nexys4 board.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - small size
     <br/>
     - supports high, mid and low resolution bitmap display
     <br/>
     - programmable display format (divide by 1,2, or 4).
     <br/>
     - programmable color depth (8,16, or 32 bpp).
     <br/>
     - 32 byte burst fetching
     <br/>
     - memory bandwidth consideration
     <br/>
     - video fifo
     <br/>
     - independent video and bus clocks
     <br/>
     - controller2
     <br/>
     --- supports the concept of color planes and can indicate if colors should appear as backdrop or frontdrop
     <br/>
     --- uses non-burst, 128 bit wide memory access
     <br/>
     - controller3
     <br/>
     --- supports more color depths: (6,8,9,12,15,16,24, and 32 bpp)
     <br/>
     --- offers more display dividers (1 to 7 times)
     <br/>
     --- uses non-burst, 128 bit wide memory access
     <br/>
     While small, this controller core has a number of interesting features. It features low resolution
     <br/>
     (low resolution these days) bitmap display. The video clock and scanline may be divided by up to 4 to provide lower resolution displays. For instance a 340 x 192 x 8bpp display can be created using a 1366x768 display mode. Memory usage is then
     <br/>
     about 64Kb. The design of the controller takes into consideration the amount of memory bandwidth available to
     <br/>
     the system, using 32 byte burst fetches to fill a fifo.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     Operation
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Operation">
     The controller fetches data in 32 byte bursts as the video fifo become empty. The 32 byte
     <br/>
     burst fetches are geared towards allowing other devices in the system to access the same memory. So
     <br/>
     that the peformance of the entire system isn't adverse. The controller relies on the memory system
     <br/>
     to support burst mode fetchs.
     <br/>
     The controller uses three independent clocks, one each for bus timing and video timing.
