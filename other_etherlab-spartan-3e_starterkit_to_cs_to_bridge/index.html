     EtherLab

    <p id="p_EtherLab">
     EtherLab sends data via Ethernet packets from the Spartan-3E StarterKit to
   a host PC or vice versa.
     <h3>
      Protocol
     </h3>
     The transport protocol is the name giving EtherLab protocol, that comes 
      directly after the Ethernet layer. An EtherLab layer provides 8 seperate
      channels each transporting 16 bit of data.
     <h3>
      Hardware
     </h3>
     The hardware reads and sends EtherLab packets only and communicates with 
      the 4 D/A Converters, LEDs, swithes, buttons, digital inputs and outputs.
     <h3>
      EtherSocket
     </h3>
     EtherSocket is a C# implementation based on Pcap.Net and provides the bare
      minimum functions to read and send EtherLab datagrams. Incomming data is 
      read constantly in a seperate thread. To send data, the user first updates
      at least one channel and sends the entire updated packet afterwards.
     <h3>
      LabVIEW
     </h3>
     The C# EtherSocket implementation has been ported to LabVIEW. Polymorphic
      VIs provide custom read and update operations for Booleans and Floats.
