     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     SpaceWire (SpW) grown organically from the needs of on-board processing applications. It's a network of spacecraft/aerocraft with Routers.
     <br/>
     Instead of customization in builting system on a project-by-project basis resulting in long development at high cost and risk, SpaceWire focused on the definition of an network architecture for payload data systems. Processing units, mass-memory units and down-link telemetry systems developed for one mission can be readily used on another mission, reducing the cost of development, improving reliability.
     <br/>
     (SpaceWire is currently being installed on several NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) spaceships to support onboard communications during space missions.
     <br/>
     ---27 January, 2003)
     <br/>
     SpaceWire standard has taken into consideration two existing standards, IEEE 1355-1995 and ANSI/TIA/EIA-644.
