     The MB-Lite microprocessor is a ligth-weight implementation of the Microblaze Instruction Set Architecture. It is instruction and cycle compatible with the Microblaze EDK 10.1i. It is successfully tested on older and newer Xilinx platforms (EDK 9 and 11). The design has been successfully synthesized for an Altera board as well to show platform independence.

     MB-Lite is a highly modular design and is therefore very simple to understand and modify. Features of the MicroBlaze architecture and MB-Lite implementation are:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      32-bit data- and instruction bus
     </li>
     <li>
      Harvard architecture
     </li>
     <li>
      Five pipeline stages
     </li>
     <li>
      Cycle as well as instruction compatible with the MicroBlaze Instruction Set Architecture
     </li>
     <li>
      Optional interrupt support
     </li>
     <li>
      Optional wishbone bus

     The core is designed using the
     
      two-process design methodology of Jiri Gaisler
     
     . All modules use inferred components, the design is not targeted specificly to any platform. However, currently it is only tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA. All memory blocks and registers will synthesize to BRAM on xilinx devices.

     The organization of the hardware corresponds closely to the implementation of the classic RISC pipeline of Hennesy &amp; Patterson (Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Approach).

     MB-Lite is tested on a Virtex 5 development board (XC5VLX110-3FF 1760). It is able to obtain 229 MHz (c.f. the original implementation obtains 227 MHz). Furthermore, MB-Lite has a lower Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) than MicroBlaze since MicroBlaze has a prefetch buffer which reduces the rate of instructions which can be fed into the processor. The execution time of MB-Lite is therefore approximately 10% lower than MicroBlaze.
