 * @brief  Platform independed C functions.
 *
 * @details This file introduces a set of functions for handling
 * HIBI_PE_DMA more easily. Functions are written in platform
 * independed C using macros defined in hdp_macros.h.
 *
 * @warning These functions store the HIBI_PE_DMA configuration
 * information in an internal structure to avoid unnessery
 * configuration. This implies that all communication with HIBI_PE_DMA
 * must be done with these functions or their behaviour may become
 * undefined.
