# Basic_tester_example

Purpose:
	Simple example on how to use basic_tester with hibi.
	Hibi is instantiated a) as a segment, b) from 4 wrappers
	and an OR-network. 

	Tx sends few words to rx which takes and checks
	them. Basic_tester is meant for simulation only.

Directories:
	ip_xact	IP-XACT descriptions for this system in XML
	sim	Lauch Modelsim in this directory. Use *.do files
	vhd	Top-level vhdl. This is generated by Kactus.

		Other VHDL files are in 
		ip.hwp.communication\basic_tester\1.0
		ip.hwp.communication\hibi\3.0
		ip.hwp.storage\fifos\
		ip.hwp.interface\clk\1.0
		ip.hwp.interface\reset\1.0



Platform: 
	  Test system is built with Kactus (v1.2 build 396) and tested
	  with Modelsim 10.0c in Windows XP.
