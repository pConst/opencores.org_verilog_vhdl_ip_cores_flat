% USAGE:
%
% \bibliographystyle{mybstfile} 
% \bibliography{IEEEfull,mybibfile}
%
% where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
% defined here. e.g.,
%
%
%    journal = IEEE_J_AC,
%
%
% to yield "{IEEE} Transactions on Automatic Control"
%
%
% WARNING: IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies!
% Because this file provides the full titles, you should NOT use this file
% for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.
%
% For IEEE work, you should use the abbreviated titles provided in the
% companion file, IEEEabrv.bib.
%
%
% ** NOTES **
%
% 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
%    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
%    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
%    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.
%
% 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.
%
% 3. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
%    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).
