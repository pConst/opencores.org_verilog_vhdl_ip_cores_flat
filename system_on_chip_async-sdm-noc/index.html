     <br/>
     Asynchronous Spatial Division Multiplexing Router for On-Chip Networks
     <br/>
     Version: 0.2
     <br/>
     On-chip networks or networks-on-chip (NoCs) are the on-chip communication fabric for
     <br/>
     current and future multiprocessor SoCs (MPSoCs) and chip multiprocessors (CMPs).
     <br/>
     Compared with synchronous NoCs, asynchronous NoCs have following benefits:
     <br/>
     * Tolerance to all kinds of delay variations caused by process, power and temperature
     <br/>
     variations.
     <br/>
     * Low transmission latency.
     <br/>
     * Zero dynamic power when idle.
     <br/>
     * Unified sync/async interface and easy clock domain integration.
     <br/>
     Most NoCs use the wormhole flow control method. Many complex flow control methods are
     <br/>
     built upon the wormhole method, such as virtual channel (VC), TDMA, and SDM. VC is the
     <br/>
     most utilized flow control in both sync and async NoCs. However, it is found VC
     <br/>
     compromises the throughput performance of asynchronous NoCs. This project provides a new
     <br/>
     asynchronous router structure which use SDM rather than VC. It has been shown that SDM
     <br/>
     achieve better throughput than VC in the same router configuration.
     <br/>
     This project provide a reconfigurable asynchronous SDM router which can be configured
     <br/>
     into a basic wormhole router or an SDM router with multiple virtual circuits in every
     <br/>
     direction.
     <br/>
     Features:
     <br/>
     * 5-port router for mesh network (0 south, 1 west, 2 north, 3 east, 4 local)
     <br/>
     * The dimension order routing (XY routing)
     <br/>
     * Available flow control methods: wormhole, SDM, VC
     <br/>
     * Reconfigurable number of virtual circuits, buffer size, data width
     <br/>
     * Fully synthesizable router implementation
     <br/>
     * SystemC testbench provided
     <br/>
     Languages:
     <br/>
     * Routers are written in synthesizable SystemVerilog
     <br/>
     * Test benches are provided by SystemC
     <br/>
     Software requirements:
     <br/>
     * The open source Nangate 45nm cell library
     <br/>
     * Synopsys Design Compiler (Synthesis)
     <br/>
     * Cadence IUS -- NC Simulator (for SystemC/Verilog co-simulation)
