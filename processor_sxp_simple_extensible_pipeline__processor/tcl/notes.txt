Need to add:

  -cut, copy, paste
  -replace current line
  -help text

Would be nice:

  -multi-line selection, cut, copy, paste
  -line numbers
  -labels
  -non-seqential address support

Bugs/Issues:

  -File->New command does not ask if you want to save the old program.
  -Underline of selected line is annoying.
  -File->Preferences doesn't do anything.
  -Edit->Undo and Redo don't do anything.
