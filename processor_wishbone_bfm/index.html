     Description

    <p id="p_Description">
     VHDL reads a file of instructions to perform Wishbone access, as if it's a wishbone master.
     <br/>
     Used in testing a Wishbone peripheral with out having to instantiate and program a 'CPU' function
     <br/>
     The aim is to have a text file with commands in it, which is the only bit that needs to be modified for different tests.
     <br/>
     This test file is read in to the units, which runs the test.

     First bits of VHDL put into CVS.
     <br/>
     Have in package commands
     <br/>
     W32 and R32 for 32 bit reads and writes.
     <br/>
     BKW32 and BKR32 for block read and write.
     <br/>
     RMW32 for read modify write.
     <br/>
     Top level is wbtb_1m_1s.vhd
     <br/>
     Commands can be added to wb_master.vhd
     <br/>
     next stage is do add a multi master capability, and to respond to bus errors and time outs.
     <br/>
     BTW: Please feel free to feed back what and how you think this should go. I can't promise to take all on board, but I'm flying blind here and making this up as I go along from scratch, with what I'd want.
     <br/>
     Feed back welcome.
