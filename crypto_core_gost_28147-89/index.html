     Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Description">
     This is a implementation of the GOST 28147-89 - a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher.
     <br/>
     GOST 28147-89 has a 64-bit blocksize and 256-bit keysize.
     <br/>
     This implementation provide trade off size and performance. The goal was to be able to fit in to a low cost Xilinx Spartan series FPGA and still be as fast as possible. As one can see from the implementation results below, this goal has been achieved.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - SystemVerilog RTL and TB code is provided
     <br/>
     - Implements both encryption and decryption in the same block
     <br/>
     - GOST 28147-89 algorithm focusing on very low area applications
     <br/>
     - Implementation takes about 32 cycles to encrypt/decrypt a block
     <br/>
     - EBC-cipher mode support
     <br/>
     - The core complies to use of S-box according to RFC4357/GOST R34.11-94 or RFC5830 (by synthesis), or S-box switch "on the fly" (realtime).

     - Core implementations have been tested on a Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA succesfully

    <p id="p_Employment">
     For run synthesize design using Synplify tool use command:
     <pre>
      $ make synthesis
     </pre>
     To compile and run simulation RTL-design using ModelSim with CLI:
     <pre>
      $ make sim
     </pre>
     To compile and run simulation RTL-design using ModelSim with GUI:
     <pre>
      $ make sim-gui
     </pre>
     In order to determine which S-box will be used for synthesis/simulation you must to pass apropriate define by command line argument:
     <pre>
      <b>
       GOST_R_3411_TESTPARAM
      </b>
      - for RFC4357 S-box using
      <b>
       GOST_R_3411_CRYPTOPRO
      </b>
      - for RFC5830 S-box using
      <b>
       GOST_R_3411_BOTH
      </b>
      - both RFC4357 and RFC5830 S-boxes using with switching "on the fly"
     </pre>
     All procedures like synthesis or simulation was tested on the Linux environment (x86_64 host).

     The design uses SystemVerilog as language for RTL-implementation therefore your Design Tools should support SystemVerilog for synthesis and simulation.

     - Implementation testing with support Botan crypto-lib. It can be used in a DPI-based testbench as golden model or test vector generator
     <br/>
     - Support for following cipher modes: CBC, CFB, OFB (and maybe CTR)
     <br/>
     - Adding SoC-buses compatibility for seamless integration
