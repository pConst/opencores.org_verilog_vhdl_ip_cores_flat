     GLADIC is a group of people working with integrated circuits in Latin America that have done some work with integrated circuits or participated in training in the part of the digital flow. We hope that our IPs are also vital in any way the proposal for those who want to use it and it goes to silicon. We encourage anyone to make a donation to the OpenCores to offer this opportunity to people to disclose their work and promote the development of microelectronics area.

     This block consists of an encryption and decryption core that have the ECB mode, CBC, CTR. These modes have different types of jobs that are described in the above referenced manual. Each of these modes possesses other sub modes that are encryption / decryption / key generation / decryption with derivative of the original key. Also possesses configuration modes for switching / errors / DMA which is done through the configuration register. During processing in any way you can tell been reading another register that indicates the current state that the IP.

      IP verification
     </h3>
    </p>
    <p>
     As the OpenCores encourages the use of free tools to check RTL so I decided to use the vpi / pli interface with C / C ++ in icarus verilog simulator to perform functional verification AES 128. The preparation of the verification environment was to plan test cases that validate each of the features developed by design. These cases mounted on the environment are individual tasks that enabled individually configure the DUT so that each cycle their outputs meet the rules set out in understanding the verifier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally a monitor to capture information and evaluate the result as the outputs are valid according the values already known. This environment does not have code coverage then there is no way to access how much code has been covered so far. We have the follow test cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      AES_WR_ONLY
     </li>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Checks for change in registers without the the bit that enabled the core to carry out a particular task is set.
      </li>
      <li>
       Only 1 type of test without variation of the configuration register.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <li>
      AES_WR_ERROR_DINR_ONLY
     </li>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Verifies that change in the status register and other signs depending on the value in the configuration register.
      </li>
      <li>
       There are 233 valid test possibility.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <li>
      AES_WR_ERROR_DOUTR_ONLY
     </li>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Verifies that change in the status register and other signs depending on the value in the configuration register.
      </li>
      <li>
       There are 233 valid test possibility.
