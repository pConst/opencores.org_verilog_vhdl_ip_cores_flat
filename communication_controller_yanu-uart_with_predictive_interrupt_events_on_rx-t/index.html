     Overview
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Overview">
     YANU (Yet Another Niosii Uart) has been built from scratch with the efficiency in mind in term of CPU load. A complete uCLinux TTY driver has been developed.
     <br/>
     Its main feature is that it has a TX and and RX FIFO buffers with a predictive "event to interrupt" generation.
     <br/>
     This will lead to a lower CPU usage needs in high efficiency point to point communication links at high baud rates.
     <br/>
     It has a fractional prescaler so that almost any baud rate can be generated from any input clock frequency.
     <br/>
     It detects all the common asynchronous errors (Parity,Framing,Overrun).
     <br/>
     It is programmable in terms of hardware handshake, number of bits and stop bits; it can generate break conditions, etc...
     <br/>
     It has an Avalon compliant bus interface and it has been tested successfully in Altera FPGAs (average logic block usage is 330 logic cells in CycloneIII family).
