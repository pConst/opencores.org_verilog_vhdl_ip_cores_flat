     openHMC is an open-source project developed by the Computer Architecture Group (CAG) at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. It is a vendor-agnostic, AXI-4 compliant Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) controller that can be parameterized to different data-widths, external lane-width requirements, and clock speeds depending on speed and area requirements.
     The main objective of developing the HMC controller is to lower the barrier for others to experiment with the HMC, without the risks of using commercial solutions.

     The openHMC controller is presented as a high-level block diagram in the figure below. The asynchronous input and output FIFOs allow the user to access the memory controller from a different clock domain. On the transceiver side, a registered output holds the data reordered on a lane-by-lane basis; allowing seamless integration with any transceiver types. A register-file provides access to control and monitor the operation of the memory controller.

     - Full link-training, sleep mode, and link retraining
     - 16Byte up to 128Byte read and write (posted and non-posted) transactions
     - Posted and non-posted bit-write and atomic requests
     - Mode Read and Write
     - Full packet flow control
     - Packet integrity checks (sequence number, packet length, CRC)
     - Full link retry
