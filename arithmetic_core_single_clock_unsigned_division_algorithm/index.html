     Now two division algorithms are wide spread in computing: restoring and non-restoring algorithms. They consider that both algorithms may be used in sequential calculation scheme, when one digit of the result is achieved during one clock. However there are no principle objections against getting all digits of the quotient and the remainder during one clock. So the author tried to develop such kind of algorithm.

     Restoring algorithm is seemed to be sequential in nature because during remainder restoring there is positive feedback (A=A &#8211; B + B at the same cycle). To avoid the feedback it is necessary to insert register for intermediate result storing. 
Thus, non-restoring algorithm was chosen as basic for one-clock division algorithm.

     Recursive approach was chosen due to it provides compact and transparent description. It is easy to see that synthesis result of the description is sequence of adders.
