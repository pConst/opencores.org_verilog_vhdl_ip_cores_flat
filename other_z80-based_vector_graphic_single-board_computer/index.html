    <p id="p_Description">
     An implementation of the
     
      Vector Graphic, Inc. Computer System
     
     of the early 1980's on a
     
      Xilinx Spartan 3E Starter Kit
     
     .  The
     
      Vector ZCB and FlashWriter II
     
     video card are implemented.  The system also includes a memory management unit, serial ports, and keyboard interface.  This design is based on several cores from
     
      OPENCORES.ORG.
     
     You can see some pictures of it running
     
      on my blog.

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     - Vector ZCB CPU Card
  - Uses OpenCores
     
      Wishbone High-Performance Z80 CPU Core
     
     - Can optionally use the OpenCores
     
      TV80 CPU Core
     
     if the wb_tv80 Wishbone wrapper is used.
  - Vector Graphic MON4.3 monitor stored in block RAM.
  - Two UARTs (Compatible with Vector Monitor)
  - PS/2 Keyboard interface to emulate the original parallel ASCII keyboard.
- Flashwriter II Video Card
  - Uses OpenCores
     
      Monochrome Text-Mode VGA Video Display Adapter
     
     with custom Wishbone wrapper and original fonts from the Vector Graphic Flashwriter II.  Display size changed to 80x24 to match the Flashwriter II.
- Vector HD/FD Disk Controller
   - Uses StrataFLASH on Spartan 3E Board for storage.
   - Read-Only
- Other
   - Memory Management Unit
   - Uses OpenCores
     
      Asynchronous DDR SDRAM controller
     
     - Wishbone backplane created using a modified version of OpenCores
     
      WISHBONE Builder

     Status

     - Dec 15, 2008 Update
     <br/>
     - Made UARTs compatible with Bitstreamer Card
     <br/>
     - Can select either Mon 4.0C (serial) or Mon 4.3 (Flashwriter2) Monitor.
     <br/>
     - Can boot CP/M using Mon 4.0C. this allows logging of console output.
     <br/>
     - Fixed shifted keys bug in ASCII Keyboard.  CTRL and Arrow keys not working.
     <br/>
     - Fixed first character of each line corruption in Flashwriter2.
     <br/>
     - Dec 7, 2008 Update
     <br/>
     - Can boot CP/M 2.2 from Vector HD-FD controller.
     <br/>
     - Ran exz80all.com instruction set exerciser.  Some test failures.
     <br/>
     - DDR Controller commented out, replaced with block RAM where possible:
     <br/>
     - New memory map: 0-2FFF, B000-FFFFh RAM, enough for CP/M with 12K TPA.
     <br/>
     - Running CP/M Exposes some PS/2 Keyboard bugs with shifted and CTRL characters.
     <br/>
     - Tested on Spartan 3E Starter Kit
     <br/>
     - Z80 Core, MMU, Flashwriter II, keyboard interface, UART working
     <br/>
     - DDR SDRAM Controller has problems in this design and needs debugging.  The RAM data retention seems fine, but I think the cache has an issue.  The memr.com program can be run under CP/M to provide a thorough memory test.
     <br/>
     - Can run the Vector Monitor 4.3 (Flashwriter for I/O) and Monitor 4.0C (Serial I/O)
