    <p id="p_Description">
     The k68 is a 68k binary compatible CRISC processor. It supports all twelve (12) addressing modes and most of the instructions for a 68000. It has 32-bit external address and data busses. It has eight (8) data and eight (8) address registers where the last address register also acts as a Stack Pointer. It has only one mode of operation and  makes no distinction between user mode and supervisor mode.

     Status
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Status">
     - Not optimized. (I figure that the architecture could be further optimized).
     <br/>
     - Files available in CVS
     <br/>
     - Many unresolved bugs (if you intend to work on it, please email me to get a head start).
     <br/>
     - I'm still working on improving it bit-by-bit (pun intended)
     <br/>
     - It is prototyped and working on a Spartan2-200 at 20+MHz without hardware MUL/DIV.
