    <p id="p_Description">
     This project implements a simple parametrized FFT engine.
     <br/>
     The user may define length of FFT (fftlen equal to a power of 2), and may also define the format of numbers used.
     <br/>
     To change the format of numbers, the user must change definition of the icpx_number (internal complex number) type defined in the icpx_pkg.vhd file.
     <br/>
     It is also necessary to adjust the conversion functions defined in this file.
     <br/>
     The user must also modify the butterfly.vhd file, so that the entity "butterfly" performs calculations on the user defined type.
     <br/>
     There are two implementations available.
     <br/>
     In the first one (in single_unit directory), all calculations are performed by a single "butterfly block".
     <br/>
     In the second one (in multiple units directory), there is one "butterfly block" for each stage of the
     <br/>
     radix-2 implementation. Therefore the calculation is performed much faster.
     <br/>
     Additionally this implementation allows to calculate FFT on a stream of data with
     <br/>
     overlapping blocks. New FFT is calculated after next block of input data with length of fftlen/2 is read.
     <br/>
     In this implementation also the window function may be used to limit the spectral leakage.
     <br/>
     Both implementations rely on known latency of the "butterfly" block.
     <br/>
     In the first implementation it is defined by the constant BTFLY_LATENCY in the fft_engine.vhd file.
     <br/>
     In the second implementation it is defined by the constant MULT_LATENCY in the fft_engine.vhd file, and additionally
     <br/>
     it is used as a latency of the multiplier multiplying the data by the window function).
     <br/>
     It is assumed, that butterfly block (and the multiplier in the second implementation) work in a pipeline mode
     <br/>
     (so new data may be delivered to the input every clock pulse, and the results are output after the known latency.
     <br/>
     The single_unit implementation to speed up processing, uses two DPRAMs for data.
     <br/>
     It allows to read both input data for the "butterfly block" simultaneously, and to write both results simultaneously.
     <br/>
     When the engine completes calculations, the results may be read from the output, and simultaneously the new data may be written to the output (it is granted that different DPRAMs are used for input and output).
     <br/>
     The multiple_units implementation uses DPRAMs in "read before write" configuration, to allow simultaneous operation of all
     <br/>
     stages of the radix-2 FFT.
     <br/>
     The design is prepared for simulation with ghdl.
     <br/>
     The script "test_fft.m" may be run in Octave (probably also in Matlab) to check, that the core works correctly.
     <br/>
     It configures the core for selected FFT length, generates the test data, compiles and runs the simulation and displays comparison between the results calculated with floating point FFT and results calculated by the simulated core.
     <br/>
     The implementation of the "butterfly block" is not optimal (e.g. it lacks proper rounding) and therefore there may be small differences between those values.
     <br/>
     For simulation you need the following free software packages:
     <br/>
     ghdl (
     
      http://ghdl.free.fr
     
     )
     <br/>
     octave (
     
      http://www.octave.org
     
     )
     <br/>
     You may also install gtkwave, to view internal signals (simulation may generate the .ghw file for gtkwave).
     <br/>
     The code is synthesizable. It has been successfully synthesized with ISE toolkit from Xilinx.
     <br/>
     For FFT length of 256 (LOG2_FFT_LEN=8) and complex numbers with 16-bit real and imaginary parts (ICPX_WIDTH=16), the resources consumption is as follows:
