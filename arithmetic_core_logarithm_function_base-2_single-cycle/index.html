     First uploaded version is in Verilog, with pipelining to maximize the clock frequency. An example implementation: It takes less than 2% of the smallest CycloneIII, and runs at 250MHz on the IOs. Probably even higher if internal-only. It even fits in a mid-sized CPLD!
     <br/>
     Second version strips outs the pipelining registers. Simpler if you don't need the throughput. This one clocks in at 14ns propagation delay pin-pin on the same CycloneIII. Not a bad speed for a logarithm, right? :-)  (BTW, the syntax here requires System Verilog)
     <br/>
     The third version is similar to the first, except the fractional LUT has been expanded for higher accuracy and resolution.
     <br/>
     If you use any of these, please write and tell me about it!
