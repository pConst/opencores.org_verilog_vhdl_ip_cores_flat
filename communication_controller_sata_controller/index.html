     Simulations are working
     <br/>
     Currently the stack is confusing to use, I'm working on this.
     <br/>
     I do not intend to push developer versions of the code to opencores if you are interested in observing the developer cores I work primarily through github:

      Nysa SATA Github

     TODO: Modify Link layer so that it only instantiates one instance of a single scrambler, not two

     To Use:
     <br/>
     Currently the stack is complicated to use: The simulations show how it is intended to be used. I am working on both a wishbone and non-wishbone controller to simplify the process.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Soapbox:
     <br/>
     Although I believe this code should be distributed for free and people should redistribute their software I leave the ethics up to the user and have licensed most of the code as MIT but I did use some GPL cores and if the user desires to use this in their closed source project be warned about the GPL'ed modules in this stack.
