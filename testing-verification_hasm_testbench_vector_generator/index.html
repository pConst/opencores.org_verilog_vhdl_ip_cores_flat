     HASM Description
    </h2>
    <p id="p_HASM Description">
     HASM is a simple instruction simulator for use in the verification of FPGA/CPLD designs that must attach to a processor bus. HASM is meant to attach to a bus model that mimics the device attached to the FPGA or CPLD under test. HASM can be used as though it were a processor within the simulation environment without the tremendous increase in simulation times due to the overhead involved in simulating a real processor.
     <br/>
     The HASM instruction simulator is comprised of two components: a Windows-based IDE and a VHDL module capable of reading the vector file generated by the HASM IDE. HASM 'programs' are written using assembler-like instructions. These instructions include Calls and Jumps to allow the testbench vector listing to be traversed linearly or recursively.
     <br/>
     HASM is meant to attach to a bus-specific VHDL core. The HASM VHDL module incorporates a simple, generic bus to ease the creation of the bus-specific module. This generic bus supports single and burst-oriented accesses. In addition, the HASM core contains an interrupt line that causes the HASM core to jump to a user-defined location in the HASM source program.
     <br/>
     Currently HASM has completed bus models for VME bus, Marvell Discovery Device Bus, Xilinx's IPIF bus, Analog Devices' ADSP-21160 Sharc bus and the 68K-based Motorola QUICC.
