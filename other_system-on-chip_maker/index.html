    <p id="p_Status">
     A first "Hellow World" SOC has been created, simulated, synthesized and tested
     <br/>
     on a Spartan-3AN starter kit board.
     <br/>
     The system consists of an OpenRISC CPU, some on-chip memory and a UART core
     <br/>
     (see ./examples/or1200_test).
     <br/>
     Furthermore, some dummy cores have been assembled to a hierarchical system,
     <br/>
     where a SOC contains a few cores and a sub-SOC.
     <br/>
     The following cores are integrated into the SOC-Maker core library and can be used:
     <br/>
     - the Advanced Debug System (
     
      http://opencores.org/project,adv_debug_sys
     
     )
     <br/>
     - the OR1200 OpenRISC processor (
     
      http://opencores.org/or1k/Main_Page
     
     )
     <br/>
     - the ram_wb from the openrisc project (
     
      http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openrisc/openrisc/trunk/orpsocv2/rtl/verilog/ram_wb
     
     )
     <br/>
     - the UART16550 module (
     
      http://opencores.org/project,uart16550
     
     )
     <br/>
     - a wishbone bus connection from the min-soc project (
     
      http://www.minsoc.com
     
     )
    </p>
   </div>
   <div id="d_Motivation">
    <h2>
     
     
     Motivation
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Motivation">
     The motivation of this project is the need of an open-source application
     <br/>
     to create system-on-chips easily and fast on a higher level than vhdl or verilog.
     <br/>
     By creating a generic application, it can support a wide range of
     <br/>
     processors, cores, controllers and bus-topologies.
     <br/>
     By using the SoC-Maker, it should be easy for a system-designer to assemble
     <br/>
     multiple IP-cores together with a low effort and without low-level knowledges.
     <br/>
     Furthermore, pre-defined SoCs can be published and extended. This makes it
     <br/>
     interesting for IP-core developers. An existing SoC created with the
     <br/>
     Soc-Maker can be easily extended by a custom IP core which is then tested
     <br/>
     and used.
     <br/>
     Not only memory-mapped systems are a target application, also signal-processing
     <br/>
     systems are interesting, where signal-processing blocks are concatenated.
     <br/>
     One useful example is an Open-RISC based SoC, where it would be nice, if
     <br/>
     core and system-developers can easily create a SoC with an
     <br/>
     Open-RISC CPU. The need of a detailed knowledge of the Open-RISC, the Wishbone
     <br/>
     bus and so on is not needed anymore.
     <br/>
     A second example is a any kind of wireless receiver, where signals are filtered, mixed,
     <br/>
     decimated and further processed. All the signal processing can be put
     <br/>
     together into a subsystem with
     <br/>
     parameters (mixer-resolution, decimation-rate and son on). On a higher level, this
     <br/>
     sub-system can then be used in a typical memory-mapped SoC together with other
     <br/>
     IP-cores and sub-systems.

   <div id="d_The Goal">
    <h2>
     
     
     The Goal
    </h2>
    <p id="p_The Goal">
     <b>
      The goal in one sentence
     </b>
     : the SoC-Maker should make it possible to parameterize and assemble 
one or multiple IP-cores into one IP-core on a high level.
     <br/>
     <b>
      IP-core
     </b>
     <br/>
     IP stands for Intellectual Property and the definition can be found on wikipedia: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core
     <br/>
     <b>
      Parameterization
     </b>
     <br/>
     Parameterization of IP-cores says, that the user can configure and setup all
required parameters of an IP-core.
     <br/>
     <b>
      Assembly
     </b>
     <br/>
     Assembly in this context means, that the IP-cores are connected in a pre-defined
or user-defined way, that the final IP-core works as required by the 
user.
     <br/>
     <b>
      One or Multiple IP cores
     </b>
     <br/>
     The minimum number of IP-cores, which are used in such a system is one. Of course,
the common case is that more than one IP-core is used to create one final
IP-core.
     <br/>
     <b>
      Into one IP core
     </b>
     <br/>
     The assembly into one IP-core can be seen in different ways: on the one hand, 
this final IP-core can be seen as a System-on-Chip. On the other-hand, it can 
be defined as a subsystem with additional parameters. This parameters are then
passed to the single IP-cores. The subsystem, which is one big IP-core, can then
be used in other systems or sub-systems.
     <br/>
     <b>
      The High Level
     </b>
     <br/>
     The high level says, that the user must not work on code or RTL level.
Furthermore, the high-level can can be different: one way could be
a graphical user interface. A second way might be an easy to read ASCII file 
written for example in XML, YAML or JSON.

   <div id="d_Requirements">
    <h2>
     
     
     Requirements
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Requirements">
     - The user is able to organize IP cores and interfaces in a library, which includes
     <br/>
     * adding existing IP cores / interfaces
     <br/>
     * removing IP cores / interfaces
     <br/>
     * displaying IP cores (which are in the library)
     <br/>
     * adding IP cores to the target-SOC
     <br/>
     - There should be a library functionallity: the library should hold
     <br/>
     * core definitions
     <br/>
     * interface definitions
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - There should exist a core definition for each core. The definition should define the following data
     <br/>
     * all source files, which are required for synthesis only
     <br/>
     * all source files, which are required for simulation only
     <br/>
     * all source files, for synthesis and simulation
     <br/>
     * top-level source file
     <br/>
     * top-level port and parameters
     <br/>
     * parameter configuration and validation
     <br/>
     * an option to download/check out files from a repository (svn, git ...)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - There should exist an interface specification for each interface used in the library
     <br/>
     * The interface specification defines, how the IP cores are connected
     <br/>
     * Allow versioning
     <br/>
     * Allow a wide range of topologies
     <br/>
     - There should be a SOC definition
     <br/>
     The SOC definition defines, which IP cores are used
     <br/>
     by the target-SOC, how they are connected and how the IP cores
     <br/>
     are parameterized.
     <br/>
     - IP-core configuration
     <br/>
     It must be possible to configure an IP core. The configurable parameters
     <br/>
     are defined in the IP-core definition and set in the SOC definition.
     <br/>
     The parameters are then used to instantiate the IP-core during the HDL generation
     <br/>
     - Toplevel-Generation
     <br/>
     The SoC maker should auto-generate a toplevel in VHDL or Verilog.
     <br/>
     Both HDL languages should be supported for generation.
     <br/>
     - Configuration Files
     <br/>
     All configuration should be stored in YAML files, this includes
     <br/>
     * SOC definition
     <br/>
     * Core definition
     <br/>
     * Interface specification
     <br/>
     * SoC maker configuration
