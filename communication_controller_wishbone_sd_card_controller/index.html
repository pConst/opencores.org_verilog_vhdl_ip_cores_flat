    <p id="p_Description">
     The Wishbone SD Card Controller IP Core is MMC/SD communication controller designed to be
     <br/>
     used in a System-on-Chip. The IP core provides a simple interface for any CPU with Wishbone
     <br/>
     bus. The communication between the MMC/SD card controller and MMC/SD card is performed
     <br/>
     according to the MMC/SD protocol.

     Introduction
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Introduction">
     This core is based on the "sd card controller" project from
     <br/>
     
      http://opencores.org/project,sdcard_mass_storage_controller
     
     <br/>
     but has been largely rewritten. A lot of effort has been put
     <br/>
     forth to make the core more generic and easily usable
     <br/>
     with OSs like Linux.
     <br/>
     - data transfer commands are not fixed
     <br/>
     - data transfer block size is configurable
     <br/>
     - multiple block transfer support
     <br/>
     - R2 responses (136 bit) support

     Features
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Features">
     The MMC/SD card controller provides following features:
     <br/>
     - 1- or 4-bit MMC/SD mode (does not support SPI mode),
     <br/>
     - 32-bit Wishbone interface,
     <br/>
     - DMA engine for data transfers,
     <br/>
     - Interrupt generation on completion of data and command transactions,
     <br/>
     - Configurable data transfer block size,
     <br/>
     - Support for any command code (including multiple data block tranfser),
     <br/>
     - Support for R1, R1b, R2(136-bit), R3, R6 and R7 responses.

    <p id="p_Examples">
     A sample ORPSoC project that make use of this core is located at:
     <br/>
     
      https://github.com/mczerski/orpsoc-de0_nano
     
     <br/>
     The project is based on de0_nano board with custom made expansion board
     <br/>
     with SD Card connector.
     <br/>
     There is also u-boot project port for this board located at:
     <br/>
     
      https://github.com/mczerski/u-boot
     
     <br/>
     This u-boot project contains driver for Wishbone SD Card Controller IP Core
     <br/>
     and can be configured for de0_nano board (with custom made expansion board).
     <br/>
     Also in the plan is the driver for Linux. The initial work can be found at:
     <br/>
     
      https://github.com/mczerski/linux
     
     - de0_nano branch
     <br/>
     the driver is named ocsdc and is located in drivers/mmc/host directory.

     TODO
    </h2>
    <p id="p_TODO">
     - top level testbench cleanup (sd_controller_top_tb.sv)
     <br/>
     - rx/tx fifo treshold to do block transfers rather than many single word transfers
     <br/>
     - maybe one fifo rather than two fifos (rx and tx) would suffice since the transfer
     <br/>
     between card and controller is always half-duplex
     <br/>
     - read only and card detect signals support
     <br/>
     - timeout watchdog for data transfers
