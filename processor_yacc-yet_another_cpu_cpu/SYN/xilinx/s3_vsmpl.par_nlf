INFO:NetListWriters:633 - The generated Verilog netlist contains Xilinx SIMPRIM
   simulation primitives and has to be used with SIMPRIM simulation library for
   correct compilation and simulation. 
INFO:NetListWriters:580 - If Verilog simulation is performed outside the ISE
   Project Navigator environment, please add $XILINX/verilog/src/glbl.v to the
   simulator compile and invocation commands in order to allow proper
   initialization of the design. If simulation is performed within Project
   Navigator, this will be taken care of automatically. For more information on
   compiling and performing Xilinx simulation, consult the online Synthesis and
   Verification Design Guide:
