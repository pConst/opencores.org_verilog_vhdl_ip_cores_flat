<P><B>1.0 Overview</B><BR>
<BR>
YACC (<B>Y</B>et <B>A</B>nother <B>C</B>PU <B>C</B>PU) is MIPS I (TM) subset cpu written&nbsp;in&nbsp;Verilog.-2001HDL.&nbsp;YACC
has 5 pipeline and shows 110DMIPS in stratix2 with synthesized allowable
clock of 165MHz. It is independent design of plasma, although YACC&nbsp;uses&nbsp;gcc-elf-mips
tools&nbsp;provided&nbsp;by&nbsp;Steve&nbsp;Rhords,&nbsp;author&nbsp;of&nbsp;plasma&nbsp;(Most&nbsp;mips&nbsp;written&nbsp;in&nbsp;VHDL).<BR>
The core was developed by using Veritak Simulator, with post layout gate
simulation, and tested by actual FPGAs, using Xilinx spartan3 starter kit
and Cyclone by Altera,running 800 digits of pi calculation ,(255,223) Reed
Solomon Error Correction ,and Interactive calculator written by C language.</P>

<B> 1.3 Background</B><BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
When I am developing VHDL to Verilog translator , I found plasma core in opencores. It is excellent work to learn a lot. After I&nbsp;<A href="http://www.sugawara-systems.com/opencores/plasma.htm">translated&nbsp;plasma</A> written by VHDL to Verilog HDL&nbsp;almost&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;using
Veritak Translator, I stated to design my own CPU per following target
spec.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>works with free C compiler -&gt;use plasma resources 
  <LI>pretend to be <B><I>fast</I></B>&nbsp;(Actually ..)
  <UL>
    <LI>5 stage pipeline
    <LI>use dual port memory in&nbsp;FPGA (Dhrystone benchmark test requires only
    16KB memory !)
  </UL>
  <LI>works with Altera/Xilinx FPGAs 
  <LI>with minimum logic cells in FPGA
