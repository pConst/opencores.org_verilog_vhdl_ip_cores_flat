     A 32-bit MIPS processor which aims for conformance to the MIPS32 Release 1 ISA. This processor implementation was designed and built by Grant Ayers as part of the eXtensible Utah Multicore (XUM) project at the University of Utah, 2011-2012. Feel free to send questions or feedback to grant DOT ayers AT stanford.edu.

     Details
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Details">
     - Single-issue in-order 5-stage pipeline with full forwarding and hazard detection.
     <br/>
     - Harvard architecture with separate instruction and data ports which can be combined if desired.
     <br/>
     - All required MIPS32 instructions are implemented, including hardware multiplication and division, fused multiply/adds, atomic load linked / store conditional, and unaligned loads and stores.
     <br/>
     - Complete Coprocessor 0 allows ISA-compliant interrupts, exceptions, and user/kernel modes.
     <br/>
     - No MMU and no FPU, with toolchain support for software-based floating point.
     <br/>
     - Hardware divider is small, multicycle, and runs asynchronously from the pipeline allowing some masking of latency.
     <br/>
     - Memory interface is separate from the processor for flexibility with connecting various RAMs.
     <br/>
     - Hardware is Big-Endian by default and supports reverse-endian mode for User mode.
     <br/>
     - Parameterized addresses for exception/interrupt vectors and boundary address between user/kernel regions.
     <br/>
     - Extensive documentation in-source and elsewhere.
     <br/>
     - Vendor-independent code.
     <br/>
     - A clean, modular design written from scratch.
     <br/>
     The project includes a standalone MIPS32 processor as well as a full System-on-Chip design targeted for the XUPV5-LX110T board. With minor changes (clock module, BRAM module, and pin constraints) the SoC can run on many hardware platforms.
     <br/>
     The standalone processor utilizes approximately 1,800 slice registers (2%) and 4,000 LUTs (5%) on a Virtex 5 LX110T.
     <br/>
     The SoC utilizes approximately 2,700 slice registers (3%) and 5,100 LUTs (7%) on a Virtex 5 LX110T.

     Other Inclusions

    <p id="p_Other Inclusions">
     The following MMIO hardware drivers are included as part of the SoC design:
     <br/>
     - Basic single-master I2C driver.
     <br/>
     - 16x2 LCD driver for Sitronix ST7066U, Samsung S6A0069X / KS0066U, Hitachi HD44780, SMOS SED1278, or other compatible hardware.
     <br/>
     - LED driver.
     <br/>
     - Piezo transducer driver.
     <br/>
     - Switch input filter.
     <br/>
     - 115200 baud 8-N-1 serial port using only Tx and Rx with configurable baud rate.
     <br/>
     - 592 KB BRAM and clock generation for XUPV5 board.
     <br/>
     The following software is included:
     <br/>
     - XUM bootloader which loads programs from a PC to the FPGA. This is written in C# for Windows, however the boot protocol is simple and can be implemented in any operating system or not used at all.

     Software Toolchain
    </h2>
    <p id="p_Software Toolchain">
     The software toolchain is based on Binutils, GCC, and Newlib. It can be built for almost any platform, including unix-like environments and Windows (Cygwin). Instructions are included with the project.
     <br/>
     The current toolchain uses Binutils 2.21, GCC 4.7.1 (mpfr 3.0.1, mpc 0.9, gmp 5.0.5), and Newlib 1.20.0.
     <br/>
     The toolchain currently supports Big- and Little-Endian code as well as software floating point. Newlib C library stubs are left unchanged.
